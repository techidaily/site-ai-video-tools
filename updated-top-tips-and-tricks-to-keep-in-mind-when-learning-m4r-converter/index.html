<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?"></a>01<strong>3. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music File Locally"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music on Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png"
                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

If you want examples: you can <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong>, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>

Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-1"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-1"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-1" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-1"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select M4R as Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-1"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload M4A File!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve been moved to the free <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> converter, select the ‘UPLOAD M4A’ option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using the <strong>M4A to M4R Converter</strong> you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen ‘M4R’ as your desired conversion format!</p>

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-2"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-2" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-2"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-2" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png"
                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?"></a>01<strong>3. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png"
                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music File Locally"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music on Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-2"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                      alt="View File Extensions on Windows"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Rename M4A to M4R"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

If you want examples: you can <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong>, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>

Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-3"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-3"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-3" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-3"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png"
                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select M4R as Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-3"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload M4A File!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve been moved to the free <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> converter, select the ‘UPLOAD M4A’ option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using the <strong>M4A to M4R Converter</strong> you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen ‘M4R’ as your desired conversion format!</p>

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>When you’re taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you’ll need to decide if it’ll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that’s where the knowledge regarding the <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> comes in!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>

<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>

Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>

<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg"
                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg"
                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video"><a href="#1-Merge-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert"><a href="#3-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="kapwing_1"
                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>
<h4 id="5-Cellsea"><a href="#5-Cellsea" class="headerlink" title="5. Cellsea"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor" >Cellsea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip"><a href="#6-FlexClip" class="headerlink" title="6. FlexClip"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html" >FlexClip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Before you can start piecing together your video clips with this online video editing tool, you must first create an account or use your Google and Facebook accounts to sign in. You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video-3"><a href="#1-Merge-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert-3"><a href="#3-Aconvert-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
