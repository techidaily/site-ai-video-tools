<p>Being criticized for years due to its simplified technology and features, FCPX or Final Cut Pro is the next possible option other than iMovie that comes to rescue Mac users’. With surplus features like clean user-interface, video effects, transitions, and a lot more, Apple has concerted efforts, like other NLEs. Although some users find difficulty identifying specific Final Cut Pro X tools, some incredibly potent but frequently overlooked tools are still under the lid.</p>
<p>Yes, certain top-notch features like optical flow, jump cut at markers, markers as subtitles, adjustment layers, and still a lot more video editing abilities are hidden where today, we will expose a technique on how to <strong>jump-cut like a pro</strong> with FCPX. Make sure you stick till the last so that you can get to know other options related to <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong> <strong>jump cuts</strong> as well.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Create-Jump-Cuts-with-Markers-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Create-Jump-Cuts-with-Markers-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Create Jump Cuts with Markers in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Create Jump Cuts with Markers in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Jump cuts are a sort of split edit performed on your video where you can jump over your video clips to keep the desire and delete the unwanted. Although it might seem similar to cut operation, jump cuts are preferable by YouTubers and vloggers. Here is a guide to teach <strong>how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro</strong> with markers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a fresh project and import media files</strong></p>
<p>Launch the Final Cut Pro X app, and once opened, create a new project by executing “File &gt; New &gt; Project”. Type the name of your project or video, and press “<strong>OK</strong>“.</p>
<p>Now, you can start to import the video file to add the jump cuts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add markers</strong></p>
<p>Bring the video into the timeline, and play the video. To add markers before creating jump cuts on the timeline, bring the pointer to the clip where you need to divide it into segments and press “<strong>M</strong>“.</p>
<p>A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Apply jump cuts</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “<strong>Jump Cuts at Markers</strong>” option.</p>
<p>You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.</p>
<p>Thus, this is <strong>how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro</strong> by speeding up the clips based on frames hence helping the action happen in just a fraction of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-a-Jump-Cut-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-a-Jump-Cut-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let’s take a look at <strong>how to fix a jump cut</strong> by transition addition.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. After importing your media files, perform jump cuts by following the previous section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily “<strong>Flow</strong>“ transition option is used in FCPX.</p>
<p>Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Hide-Jump-Cuts-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Hide-Jump-Cuts-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know <strong>how to hide jump cuts</strong> in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Resizing the clip</strong></p>
<p>To do this method, select a clip. It could be the first one or the latter. Now, click on the “Resize” icon.</p>
<p>You can resize the clip using the circle resize option near the video preview or the “Scale” option on the right corner.</p>
<p>Doing so will add effects to the video clip hiding the jump cuts added.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Synchronizing clips</strong></p>
<p>Another way to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X is to synchronize the clip with the other relevant clip.</p>
<p>You can add another video to the timeline and place it where you created the jump cut.</p>
<p>When you prefer this method, you have to ensure that the synchronized video’s audio is on mute to avoid disturbing the actual one.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

As we all know, most video players cease playing when a video approaches its climax. You can manually reverse the portion if you wish to see it with Boomerang effects.</p>
<p>You may loop and enjoy the video you like continuously when you do a new project in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a video editor for all video content creators.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Furthermore, this multi-functional program may trim, clip, divide or combine films to your liking. To loop any video in Filmora, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch the Filmora video editor and import the video file. Click on <strong>File&gt;Import Media&gt;Import Media Files</strong>. And then drag the video file to the timeline. Do some basic editing such as trimming and cutting to get the segments that you want to loop with the Boomerang effect, if necessary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-video-segment-to-loop.jpg"
                      alt="cut video segment to loop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Copy and paste the video file on the timeline, and then change the speed of the pasted video to apply the Reverse effect. Repeat the process to loop the video as many times as you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-repeat-video-boomerang-effect.jpg"
                      alt="reverse repeat video boomerang effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Export the video files when you’re done. Click on <strong>Export</strong> and save the looping video as a video or gif, and then select the location where you want to save the file.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your taste, the number of video loops required, and the amount of information you need when creating a full-fledged film with repeats, you can use any software described above. If you need a more advanced option, Wondershare Filmora video editor is your best alternative in terms of <strong>Video Loopers</strong>. It is not only a free video looper, but it also has several additional capabilities that allow you to create a full output with granular changes.</p>
