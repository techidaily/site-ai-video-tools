However, you won’t be able to create videos longer than one minute or export videos in resolutions larger than 720p if you opt for the free version of Kizoa. If you choose the Business version of this video editing platform, you will be able to create 4K videos, and you’ll have access to unlimited cloud storage space.

Moreover, selecting this pricing model will enable you to use RAW format images in all your projects and burn your videos to DVDs. Keep in mind that the maximum duration of the video you can create with Kizoa depends on the type of license you choose.

**Pros:**

### 5\. WeVideo

Video content creators in need of an online video editing platform they can use for private, professional, and educational purposes are going to love using [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/).

This web-based video editor is stacked with features that enable you to create captivating videos with ease. In addition to impressive video editing capabilities, WeVideo also enables you to capture your computer’s screen or optimize your videos for playback on different devices.

![iMovie Online Alternative WeVideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-online-video-editor.jpg)

However, the free version of this online video editor only allows you to export five minutes of video per month while limiting the resolution to just 480p. That’s why choosing the Unlimited, Professional, or Business subscription plans that have no publish time or cloud storage restrictions is a much better option.

Moreover, if you opt for either of these plans, you will be able to export all of your videos in 4K resolution and you’ll have access to premium video editing tools.

**Pros:**

* Rich stock footage libraries
* Allows users to export audio files
* Offers screencasting tools
* Provides social media marketing options

**Cons:**

* Limited social sharing capabilities
* Adjusting a video’s frame rate is only possible if you purchase the Business subscription plan

Finding an online alternative to iMovie isn’t difficult, because there are a lot of web-based video editing platforms that enable you to perform simple video editing tasks.

Nonetheless, the free versions of online video editors often offer a limited scope of the tools you need to create videos that can attract the attention of online audiences. Still, each of the video editing platform we included in this article can be used to create different types of videos. Which of the five best free iMovie alternatives are you going to choose?

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny.
