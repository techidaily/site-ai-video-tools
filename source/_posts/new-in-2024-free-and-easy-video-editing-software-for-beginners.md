[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more.

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option.
