Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

Now, you can add captions in the preview window or the **Captions Text** given alongside.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

Press **Command + E** or go to **File** \> **Export** to open the **Export** preview window. Now, you can select the name and save your video in standard export options. Hit the **Roles** tab given at the top.

Thus, similar steps are required even if you want to add subtitles.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

## Noise Cancellation Made Easy: A Beginner's Guide to FCPX Audio Enhancement

# How to Remove Background Noise in Final Cut Pro X?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

As per research, audio plays a more vital role than the visuals in a video. Yes, no one will ever like a video that gets the audio track unrelated to the moving clip or has no voice. Similarly, suppose you are shooting or recording a live video. In that case, the most off-putting factors like **background noise**, **improper microphone**, and various distractions from the environment can affect the video or the movie quality.

Even if you perform recording in a proper studio, slight background noise can sneak into your video. So, tuning the voice or removing it is mandatory. If you are a Mac user, you can use the FCP noise removal to accomplish the task with no other third-party assistance. Please take a look at our today’s article to know **how to get rid of background noise in Final Cut Pro**. Alongside, you can also get to know some noise reduction plugins for FCPX.

And you may need this guide to learn [how to remove background noise in more ways in FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Remove Background Noise from Audio in Final Cut Pro X?

Want to know how to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro X? Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow.

**Step 1: Start new project & import files**

Once you have launched the Final Cut Pro X application on your Mac device, go to “File > New > Project”.

Name the project and customize the video on the following pop-up window. You can then import the video files by executing “File > Import > Media”.

**Step 2: Click the audio Enhancer option**

Now, take the video onto the timeline and execute “Modify > Auto Enhance Audio” from the top menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut “Command-A.”

On the options above the timeline, tap the “Magic” icon, and from the drop-down, you can choose the **Auto Enhancer Audio** option.

![audio-enhance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/audio-enhance.jpg)

You will also see another option to open an audio enhancer, which you can accomplish by clicking the **Audio** icon, which you can find above the **Preview** screen.

**Step 3: Customize the Audio inspector**

You will now get an audio enhancer or inspector toolbox on the right of the screen from where you can optimize or configure various options like equalization adjustments, loudness settings, noise removal, and hum removal.

Using FCP noise removal is so easy. And to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro X, you need to enable the **Noise Removal** checkbox and slide the pointer to a particular level. That is how to remove background noise in FCPX at ease.
