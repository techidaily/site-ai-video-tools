There are hundreds of templates available for various kinds of social media posts, so to create a photo collage you should just **pick a template**. You can **change the layout of the template** if you want to alter its original design and you can upload images from your computer or use **the Adobe Stock** option. The best part is that you can apply filters to all photos you add to a photo collage and make their colors more vivid.

#### 11. [Photo Collage Maker](https://photo-collage.net/photo-collage-maker/)

**Price:** $5.56 for a single image

Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than **250 photo collage templates** that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.
