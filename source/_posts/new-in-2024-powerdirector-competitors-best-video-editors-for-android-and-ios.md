# Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

Video editing was once exclusively the realm of the PC, but with the power of modern smartphones and tablets even professionals are more frequently editing on the go. This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.

Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.

## Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

#### 1\. Kinemaster

System: Android, iOS

Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.

#### 2\. LumaFX

System: iOS

LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.

#### 3\. iMovie – Free

System: iOS

Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.

#### 4\. Adobe Premiere Clip

System: Android, iOS

Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600\. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.

There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.

## Unleash Nostalgia: Easy VHS Effects in Final Cut Pro

# Do VHS Effect with Final Cut Pro in the Right Way

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

These days, nostalgia for the 1990s appears to be in fashion. VHS effects are among the most popular, as seen in internet photos and mobile apps. If you know how to make VHS effects, you can join the trend by making vintage-style videos.

Fortunately, you don't have to reshoot your video using an analog camera and transfer the movie to a VCR video format to achieve the effect of an old recording (with the date on the screen, tracking lines, and other telltale indications). It's made up of a few similar layers with slightly different Effects and a fun overlay layer to give it that tubular, radical '90s vibe.

In this article, you will learn how to add VHS effects to a video in Final Cut Pro X, how to use VHS video effects, and some common VHS filter choices to use in your next project, so keep reading:

## Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?

A VHS effect is a textured, warped effect that looks like an outdated analog videotape cassette recording. Adding this antique effect to an edit adds a fantastic old-school discord. How often should you utilize these glitchy and vintage effects? When the mood you're trying to create begs for some visual or aural distortion. Perhaps you need to recreate the appearance of discovered film or express a dramatic flashback to a character's history. In any case, VHS tapes and glitch effects are pretty trendy right now.

![vhs_effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/vhs_effect.jpg)

If you want to know how to add VHS effect to your videos without any plugins in Final Cut Pro X, then follow these steps:

Open Final Cut Pro and click on New Project.

Name your project as VHS effect in the Project Name section. Change the Video format to NTSC SD and frame rate to 29.97p. Click on Ok.

![change_project_name_and_format_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/change_project_name_and_format_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Drag and drop your footage in the timeline of FCPX. After this, scale your project so that it fits the frame.

Open the Effects, and in the search bar, type Add Noise. Select the Add Noise effect and drop it on your footage.

![add_noise_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add_noise_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Go to the option Blend Mode and select Color Dodge. Now click on Type and select Gaussian Noise (Film Grain). In the Amount section, add the amount between 0.23-0.32.

Now go back to the search bar and type Gaussian Blur. Select that and drop it to your footage in FCPX.

![add_guassian_blur_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add_guassian_blur_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Go to the Gaussian settings and set the amount to roughly 2.0-3.0.

Go back to the search bar in FCPX and type Sharpen. Select the Sharpen effect and drop it to your footage in Final Cut Pro.

![add_sharpness_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add_sharpness_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Set the amount of sharpness to around 8.0-9.0.

Now in the search bar type Bad TV effect. Select it and drop it on your footage in FCPX.

![add_bad_tv_effect_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add_bad_tv_effect_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Set the amount of the effect to roughly around 8.0-9.0\. In the option, Static Type, select Gaussian Noise (Film Grain). Select Soft Light in Static Blend mode option.

Now go to the search bar again and type Prism. Select the prism effect and drop it to your footage in Final Cut Pro. This will add some 3D effect to your footage.

![add_prism_effect_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add_prism_effect_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Set the amount to around 13.0-14.0.

Go back to the search bar and type Color Correction. Drag and drop this effect to your footage in Final Cut Pro.

![color_correction_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color_correction_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

Click on Exposure and adjust the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadow. Go to the Saturation option and lower it. Now go to the Color and adjust the tint of your video by changing the Global option. Also, adjust the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows. Wait for a few minutes for it to render.

After your video is rendered, you will get the final results using the VHS filter in Final Cut Pro. Your video will look like it was made in a VCR Video format.

![final_result_of_vhs_effect_in_final_cut_pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/final_result_of_vhs_effect_in_final_cut_pro.jpg)

## Part2: How to do VHS effect in easy steps?

Still not enough? See this article: [The Best Glitch Video Editors.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part3: Where to find the best plugins or templates for the VHS effect?

If you want to recreate some of that analog feel to your video clip with plugins or templates, you can use the following recommendations to give your film a VHS effect:

**Damaged VHS Effects**

This is a paid collection; however, it has an extensive library of VHS-style effects. The variety of effects is impressive, with some slight distortions and others that are almost unwatchable. There's also some stock video from TV, sound effects, and transitions. Everything may be customized to your taste.

This template will set you back $59, which is a small price to pay for such a large selection. Only After Effects CS3 and above are supported!

**VHS Opener**

This After Effects template is jam-packed with effects and glitches that are ideal for conjuring a nostalgic mood. Upload your film and customize your titles and text. This is a simple, vintage template that you may use.

**[Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

A resources center built for Filmora. You can find all the materials and effects you need in Filmstock, including VHS effect.

Click to learn more about [glitch effect in Filmstock.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![filmstock-effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmstock-effects.png)

**Stories – Glitch & VHS Edition**

This template is ideal for use with mobile apps like Instagram Stories. You'll get two vertical video openers, complete with glitches and VHS effects. Premiere Pro CC 2017 and newer are supported!

**VHS Glitch**

The look of a VHS glitch effect is basic yet incredibly authentic. This one was made in an old-school way by causing damage to the inside of a genuine VHS tape and capturing the effect. It can't get much more natural than that! To be confident of what you can and can't do with this overlay, read the license information

**Conclusion**

The appearance and feel of your production may be significantly enhanced by using VHS video effects. Nothing brings back memories for a viewer like a VHS video. By following the steps mentioned above, you can easily use the VHS effect in your video. However, we recommend you use Wondershare Filmore to create VHS effect as you wouldn't require any plugin. What are some of your favorite VHS effects?

There's also some stock video from TV, sound effects, and transitions. Everything may be customized to your taste.

This template will set you back $59, which is a small price to pay for such a large selection. Only After Effects CS3 and above are supported!

**VHS Opener**

**Stories – Glitch & VHS Edition**

This template is ideal for use with mobile apps like Instagram Stories. You'll get two vertical video openers, complete with glitches and VHS effects. Premiere Pro CC 2017 and newer are supported!

**VHS Glitch**

The look of a VHS glitch effect is basic yet incredibly authentic. This one was made in an old-school way by causing damage to the inside of a genuine VHS tape and capturing the effect. It can't get much more natural than that! To be confident of what you can and can't do with this overlay, read the license information

**Conclusion**

The appearance and feel of your production may be significantly enhanced by using VHS video effects. Nothing brings back memories for a viewer like a VHS video. By following the steps mentioned above, you can easily use the VHS effect in your video. However, we recommend you use Wondershare Filmore to create VHS effect as you wouldn't require any plugin. What are some of your favorite VHS effects?

These days, nostalgia for the 1990s appears to be in fashion. VHS effects are among the most popular, as seen in internet photos and mobile apps. If you know how to make VHS effects, you can join the trend by making vintage-style videos.

Fortunately, you don't have to reshoot your video using an analog camera and transfer the movie to a VCR video format to achieve the effect of an old recording (with the date on the screen, tracking lines, and other telltale indications). It's made up of a few similar layers with slightly different Effects and a fun overlay layer to give it that tubular, radical '90s vibe.

In this article, you will learn how to add VHS effects to a video in Final Cut Pro X, how to use VHS video effects, and some common VHS filter choices to use in your next project, so keep reading:

## Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?

A VHS effect is a textured, warped effect that looks like an outdated analog videotape cassette recording. Adding this antique effect to an edit adds a fantastic old-school discord. How often should you utilize these glitchy and vintage effects? When the mood you're trying to create begs for some visual or aural distortion. Perhaps you need to recreate the appearance of discovered film or express a dramatic flashback to a character's history. In any case, VHS tapes and glitch effects are pretty trendy right now.

![vhs_effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/vhs_effect.jpg)

If you want to know how to add VHS effect to your videos without any plugins in Final Cut Pro X, then follow these steps:

Go to the option Blend Mode and select Color Dodge. Now click on Type and select Gaussian Noise (Film Grain). In the Amount section, add the amount between 0.23-0.32.

**Stories – Glitch & VHS Edition**

This template is ideal for use with mobile apps like Instagram Stories. You'll get two vertical video openers, complete with glitches and VHS effects. Premiere Pro CC 2017 and newer are supported!

**VHS Glitch**

The look of a VHS glitch effect is basic yet incredibly authentic. This one was made in an old-school way by causing damage to the inside of a genuine VHS tape and capturing the effect. It can't get much more natural than that! To be confident of what you can and can't do with this overlay, read the license information

**Conclusion**

The appearance and feel of your production may be significantly enhanced by using VHS video effects. Nothing brings back memories for a viewer like a VHS video. By following the steps mentioned above, you can easily use the VHS effect in your video. However, we recommend you use Wondershare Filmore to create VHS effect as you wouldn't require any plugin. What are some of your favorite VHS effects?

Smartphones, compact or GoPro cameras can all capture [high-quality videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you also need video editing software to process the footage you record. The Windows Movie Maker was discontinued in 2017 and at the moment, finding a video editing software for the Windows 10 operating system that offers only basic tools can prove to be a challenging task.

However, there is no shortage of video editing apps you can use on the latest version of Windows, and in this article, we are going to explore some of the best free and paid options that can help you polish your videos on a Windows 10 computer before posting them online.

## Best Free and Paid Movie Makers for Windows 10

The list of things you should consider before you choose a video editing software for Windows10 is a lengthy one. There is no reason to spend a lot of money on an app that offers [professional video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you’re just starting out since there are more affordable options that can help you create captivating videos. Let's take a look at some of the best free and paid movie makers for Windows 10.

#### 1. Microsoft Photos

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility**: Windows 10, version 15063.0 or higher

The replacement of the Windows Movie Maker came in the form of updates to the Microsoft Photos app that now offers video editing options. Don’t expect too much, as the software’s video editing tools are limited to the essentials. You can easily perform tasks such as trimming the clips, adding music, or applying visual effects. The Remix feature lets you combine photos and videos into a single file instantly, and it can be quite useful if you’re just looking for a way to quickly make a video. Despite some attractive video editing tools, the Microsoft Photos app remains an option best suited for beginners.

Tips: Want to know how to edit videos with the Windows 10 Photos movie maker and Remix feature? Check out this article about [Windows10 Photos video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Wondershare Filmora

**Price:** Free version available, $49.99 for a 1-year subscription

**Compatibility:** Window 10/8/8.1/7

Regardless of the version of Windows, you have installed on your PC, you can use Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos on both Windows10/Windows8/Windows7\. The software offers a finely balanced combination of basic and advanced options which allows you to create a movie with fun in a professional look. All unwanted parts of video clips can be removed in a few simple clicks, while you can also perform color correction, create a PIP effect, or perform similarly complex video editing actions. You can export videos from Filmora directly to your accounts on social media such as YouTube and Vimeo, or save them to your hard drive. If you choose the free version of the software, the videos you export will contain watermarks.

The Filmora team has created many tutorials about Filmora editing tips and tricks on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY%5FLMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w), and also a complete guide for beginners about [How to Edit Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in Filmora.

The lastest version of Wondershare Filmora added more amazing features and stunning video effects, including motion tracking, audio ducking, keyframing, and so on. Try the new features now!

#### 3. Ezvid for Windows

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows 10/8/8.1/7/Vista/XP SP3/

![Ezvid for Windows interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezvid-video-maker.png)

Image from the Internet

Ezvid is primarily a screen capturing software that also offers a decent amount of video editing options. It is a great choice if you want to record video games you play or create tutorials, as you can easily define the area of the screen you’d like to capture and record all on-screen movement. The Voice Synthesis feature lets you create narration quickly, while text overlays or screen drawing options can help you highlight the most important parts of the video. Ezvid doesn’t support a lot of different video file formats, which can limit your choices during the video editing process.

#### 4. CyberLink PowerDirector 365

**Price: $19.99/Monthly**

**Compatibility:** Windows 10

PC owners who often work with HD and 4K footage, and even 360-degree videos are going to love editing in CyberLink PowerDirector. There are dozens of visual effects available as well as lens correction tools and a Motion Tracking feature that lets you blur faces or add moving text to your videos. The Multi-Camera Editor makes combining and editing footage from several sources simple and enables you to quickly switch between shots recorded by different cameras. The software’s audio editing capabilities are as impressive as its video editing tools, which means that you can create perfect soundtracks for all videos you edit with PowerDirector.

#### 5. Adobe Premiere Pro CC

**Price:** $20.99 for a monthly subscription

**Compatibility:** Windows 10 (64-bit version)

Adobe Premiere is one of the most powerful video makers ever created, as it offers virtually unlimited video editing possibilities. However, learning how to use this iconic software may take some time, since most of its features are aimed at professional filmmakers. In addition, there is no reason to pay for a $20 monthly subscription if you have no intention of ever using the majority of options the software offers. Adobe Premiere Pro CC is only a good option for Windows 10 users who constantly need access to a powerful video maker that enables them to edit their videos like professionals.

Premiere Pro has a 30-day limited trial version (with watermark included), so you can download it free on your Windows10 computer. I've done some research and found a YouTube tutorial for beginners to learn Premiere Pro CC Basics from YouTube channel Organge83\. Check it below:

**Conclusion**

Despite the fact that Windows 10 offers a limited amount of video editing software options, it isn’t too difficult to find a video maker that meets all your needs. A number of [affordable and versatile video makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Wondershare Filmora is available to PC owners who don’t want to use a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but they still need software that is powerful enough to create a high-quality video.

## Move Over WMM: Discover the Best Free and Paid Video Editors

Windows Movie Maker has been a cornerstone tool for video editors for quite a while. There are a lot of amateurs who've made use of the free program and have done wonders with it.
