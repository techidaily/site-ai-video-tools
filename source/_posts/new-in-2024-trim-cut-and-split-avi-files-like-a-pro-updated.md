DVDs are not as nearly as popular as they were in the 2000s, simply because USB flash drives are much more durable than DVD discs. One of the easiest ways to back up the data stored on DVDs is to convert it to digital video file formats, like [MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

You cannot just copy and paste the data from a DVD or Blu-ray to a computer since you need file conversion software in order to [change the format of a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
