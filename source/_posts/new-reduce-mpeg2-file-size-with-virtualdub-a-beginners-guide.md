VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats.

Now, you can start to import the video file to add the jump cuts.

**Step 2: Add markers**

Bring the video into the timeline, and play the video. To add markers before creating jump cuts on the timeline, bring the pointer to the clip where you need to divide it into segments and press "**M**".

A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.

**Step 3: Apply jump cuts**

Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “**Jump Cuts at Markers**” option.

You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.

Thus, this is **how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro** by speeding up the clips based on frames hence helping the action happen in just a fraction of seconds.

## Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?

If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let's take a look at **how to fix a jump cut** by transition addition.

**Step 1**. After importing your media files, perform jump cuts by following the previous section.

**Step 2**. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily "**Flow**" transition option is used in FCPX.

Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.

## Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?

Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know **how to hide jump cuts** in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.

**Method 1: Resizing the clip**

To do this method, select a clip. It could be the first one or the latter. Now, click on the “Resize” icon.

You can resize the clip using the circle resize option near the video preview or the “Scale” option on the right corner.

Doing so will add effects to the video clip hiding the jump cuts added.

**Method 2: Synchronizing clips**

Another way to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X is to synchronize the clip with the other relevant clip.

You can add another video to the timeline and place it where you created the jump cut.

When you prefer this method, you have to ensure that the synchronized video's audio is on mute to avoid disturbing the actual one.
