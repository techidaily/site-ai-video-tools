## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie. The video editor is developed by Apple and is already installed in leading Mac systems. While it doesn’t offer so many extensive features, iMovie would meet your basic video editing needs.

## Final Words

There you go!

Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.

## Calculate, Find, and Adjust Image Ratio

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

So, if any discordance occurs or you want to change the video aspect ratio, select the proper balance from project settings.
