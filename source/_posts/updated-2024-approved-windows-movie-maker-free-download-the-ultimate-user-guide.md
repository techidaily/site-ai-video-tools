However, the free version of this online video editor only allows you to export five minutes of video per month while limiting the resolution to just 480p.

**Pros:**

* Rich stock footage libraries
* Allows users to export audio files
* Offers screencasting tools
* Provides social media marketing options

* Adjusting a video’s frame rate is only possible if you purchase the Business subscription plan

Nonetheless, the free versions of online video editors often offer a limited scope of the tools you need to create videos that can attract the attention of online audiences.
