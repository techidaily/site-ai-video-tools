In case you are looking for a powerful video conversion tool you can use from a web browser, then Wondershare’s Online UniConverter is probably one of the best options you have. In order to convert a WebM video to MP3, you have to go through a simple four-step process. First, you need to upload a file you would like to convert, then set the output format to MP3, click on the Convert button and finally download the audio file you created to your computer. The size of a WebM video cannot exceed 100MB, but if you want to convert larger video files you can install the desktop version of this video converter on your Mac or PC computer.

### 4\. [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-mp3)

This platform offers a number of file conversion tools you can use to change the file format of archives, images, vectors or videos. CloudConvert lets you import WebM videos via URLs, from cloud storage services like OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive and from a local hard drive. Optionally you can set the start and end times for the MP3 file you’re creating, adjust its volume or change the audio bitrate. Clicking on the Convert button will start the file conversion process, and once the WebM file is processed, you should download the MP3 file to your computer.

### 5\. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/webm-mp3/)

**Compatibility:** Web-based

The fact that over five terabytes of files were converted through the Convertio platform shows you how popular and efficient this online file conversion platform actually is. Besides video files, you can also convert fonts, images or eBooks with Convertio. In order to turn a WebM video into an MP3 file you just have to upload it either from cloud storage or a local hard drive. Optionally, you can click on the Settings icon if you want to customize the bitrate, frequency or volume values. In addition, Convertio enables you to convert only a segment of a WebM video, as you can choose how much of that video you want to cut, by inserting the time in the video where the conversion should start and end.

### 6\. [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/webm-to-mp3/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This is yet another popular destination for all Internet users who convert images, videos, audio files or different types of documents on a daily basis. After you add a WebM video to Zamzar, you just have to set the output format to MP3 and click on the Convert button. Uploading a video file larger than 150MB to the free version of Zamzar is not possible and you must purchase one of the subscription models if you would like to convert WebM videos that have up to 2GB. Moreover, uploading files from the cloud isn’t an option, since Zamzar only allows its users to add files via URL or from their computers.

### 7\. [FreeFileConvert](https://www.freefileconvert.com/webm-mp3)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP3 with FreeFileConvert](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freefileconvert-webm-mp3.jpg)

You can upload up to five WebM files not larger than 300 MB to FreeFileConvert either from the cloud, a URL or your computer’s hard drive. When done, you should choose MP3 as the output format and initiate the conversion process by hitting the Convert button. The file you converted cannot be saved on the cloud or downloaded more than five times.

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP3 with File-Converter-Online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webm-to-mp3-file-converter-online.jpg)

Anyone can convert a WebM video to MP3 with File-Converter-Online because the file conversion process is remarkably easy. All you need to do is choose a file from your hard drive you would like to convert, select MP3 as the output file type and click on the Start Converting button. The download process will start automatically, once the WebM file is converted to MP3, although you won’t be able to store your freshly generated audio file on the cloud directly from this platform. There are no video size limits, which enables you to convert all WebM files regardless of how large or small they are.

### 9\. [OnlineConvertFree](https://onlineconvertfree.com/convert-format/webm-to-mp3/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $6.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP3 with OnlineConvertFree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webm-to-mp3-with-onlineconvertfree.jpg)

This is a simple but efficient file conversion tool that enables you to convert multiple WebM videos at the same time. However, if you are using the free version of the platform you won’t be able to convert more than two WebM files to MP3 simultaneously. Furthermore, the maximum size of a video file you can convert with this platform is limited to just 500MB regardless of the subscription plan you have. Opting for any of the available subscription plans will grant you access to unlimited conversion hours so that you can convert as many WebM videos as you want each day.

### 10\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) \- The Best WebM to MP3 Converter for macOS and Windows 10

![Convert WebM video to MP3 with VLC](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-format-with-vlc.jpg)

The simplest and by far the fastest way to convert a WebM video to an MP3 file on PC and Mac computers is to use the VLC media player. After you installed and launched VLC you should click on the Media menu and select the Convert/Save option.

The Open Media window will pop up on the screen, and you just have to click on the Add button located in the File Selection section of the screen in order to import a WebM video into VLC. Afterward, you should click on the Convert/Save button to gain access to the Convert window. Change the Profile setting to Audio – MP3 and click on the Browse button in the Destination section of the window if you want to choose the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved. After you click on the Start button, VLC will convert you WebM video to MP3 and place the converted file to the folder you specified.

**Conclusion**

Each video saved in WebM file format can be easily converted into an MP3 audio file you can add to your music library. Online WebM to MP3 converters often have size limits, even if you purchase a subscription. That is why it is much easier and less expensive to install VLC media player on your Mac or PC computer if you want to convert WebM videos to MP3 files frequently. What is your favorite WebM to MP3 converter? Let us know in the comments.
