MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!
