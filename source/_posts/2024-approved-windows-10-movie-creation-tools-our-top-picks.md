Smartphones, compact or GoPro cameras can all capture [high-quality videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you also need video editing software to process the footage you record. The Windows Movie Maker was discontinued in 2017 and at the moment, finding a video editing software for the Windows 10 operating system that offers only basic tools can prove to be a challenging task.

However, there is no shortage of video editing apps you can use on the latest version of Windows, and in this article, we are going to explore some of the best free and paid options that can help you polish your videos on a Windows 10 computer before posting them online.

## Best Free and Paid Movie Makers for Windows 10

The list of things you should consider before you choose a video editing software for Windows10 is a lengthy one. There is no reason to spend a lot of money on an app that offers[professional video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you’re just starting out since there are more affordable options that can help you create captivating videos. Let's take a look at some of the best free and paid movie makers for Windows 10.

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility**: Windows 10, version 15063.0 or higher

The replacement of the Windows Movie Maker came in the form of updates to the Microsoft Photos app that now offers video editing options. Don’t expect too much, as the software’s video editing tools are limited to the essentials. You can easily perform tasks such as trimming the clips, adding music, or applying visual effects. The Remix feature lets you combine photos and videos into a single file instantly, and it can be quite useful if you’re just looking for a way to quickly make a video. Despite some attractive video editing tools, the Microsoft Photos app remains an option best suited for beginners.

If you choose the free version of the software, the videos you export will contain watermarks.

#### 3. [Ezvid for Windows](https://www.ezvid.com/ezvid%5Ffor%5Fwindows)

![Ezvid for Windows interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezvid-video-maker.png)

Image from the Internet

Ezvid is primarily a screen capturing software that also offers a decent amount of video editing options. It is a great choice if you want to record video games you play or create tutorials, as you can easily define the area of the screen you’d like to capture and record all on-screen movement. The Voice Synthesis feature lets you create narration quickly, while text overlays or screen drawing options can help you highlight the most important parts of the video. Ezvid doesn’t support a lot of different video file formats, which can limit your choices during the video editing process.

#### 4. [CyberLink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

**Price: $19.99/Monthly**

**Compatibility:** Windows 10

PC owners who often work with HD and 4K footage, and even 360-degree videos are going to love editing in CyberLink PowerDirector. There are dozens of visual effects available as well as lens correction tools and a Motion Tracking feature that lets you blur faces or add moving text to your videos. The Multi-Camera Editor makes combining and editing footage from several sources simple and enables you to quickly switch between shots recorded by different cameras. The software’s audio editing capabilities are as impressive as its video editing tools, which means that you can create perfect soundtracks for all videos you edit with PowerDirector.

#### 5. [Adobe Premiere Pro CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20.99 for a monthly subscription

**Compatibility:** Windows 10 (64-bit version)

Adobe Premiere is one of the most powerful video makers ever created, as it offers virtually unlimited video editing possibilities. However, learning how to use this iconic software may take some time, since most of its features are aimed at professional filmmakers. In addition, there is no reason to pay for a $20 monthly subscription if you have no intention of ever using the majority of options the software offers. Adobe Premiere Pro CC is only a good option for Windows 10 users who constantly need access to a powerful video maker that enables them to edit their videos like professionals.

Premiere Pro has a 30-day limited trial version (with watermark included), so you can download it free on your Windows10 computer. I've done some research and found a YouTube tutorial for beginners to learn Premiere Pro CC Basics from YouTube channel Organge83\. Check it below:

**Conclusion**

Despite the fact that Windows 10 offers a limited amount of video editing software options, it isn’t too difficult to find a video maker that meets all your needs. A number of [affordable and versatile video makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Wondershare Filmora is available to PC owners who don’t want to use a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but they still need software that is powerful enough to create a high-quality video.

GlicthFX’s file-sharing capabilities present you with a number of options as you can post your latest creations on Musical.ly, Facebook, YouTube, and other popular social networks directly from the app. The only downside is that you have to make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all the VHS and glitch effects the app has to offer.

![glitch-video-effects-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-video-effects-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but contains ads

**Compatibility:** Android

If you are a fan of vaporwave aesthetics and you like making experimental mind-bending videos, then this Android-based app might be the right choice for you. The app lets you capture glitch photos and videos in real-time, so you can see how your images are going to look like even before you press the record button. There are more than a hundred trippy and glitch video effects you can choose from that enable you to recreate some vintage styles of videos or make unique videos with hallucinogenic colors. When done experimenting, you can share your Glitch art videos with your friends on social media with a single tap.

#### 3. [Groovo](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/groovo-video-effects-glitch/id1283795125?mt=8)

![groovo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/groovo.png)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzmusiq.groovo&hl=en), iOS

Groovo is a community of like-minded people where you can discover new content on a daily basis and find inspiration for your own work. This AI-powered app grants you access to huge music and visual effects libraries, which enables you to create stunning music videos effortlessly. Groovo also features basic video editing tools, so you can remove all parts of the audio or video files you don’t want to share with your friends on social media. What’s more, all the videos you create with Groovo are going to be watermark-free, but you shouldn’t expect too much from this app in terms of its video editing capabilities.

#### 4. [Glitché](https://glitche.com/)

![glitche-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitche-poster.png)

**Price:** $0,99, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner or Travis Scott are just a few among countless celebrities who are already using this app to take photos or capture videos. Glitché offers a rich selection of real-time photo and video filters you can control even while you’re still recording. There are more than 30 creative tools that let you create VHS style videos or make digital glitches in just a few simple taps, and if you want to edit your photos and videos with a more powerful software you can export your projects to Adobe Creative Cloud. However, you are going to have to make a few in-app purchases if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.

#### 5. [HYPERSPECTIVE](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/hyperspektiv/id1058051662?mt=8)

![hyperspektiv-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperspektiv-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

There is so much more you can do with this app, besides creating glitch art, because even the free version HYPERSPECTIVE offers a powerful mirroring system and a rich selection of visual effects. In order to be able to record videos for your Instagram stories, you must upgrade to the paid version of the app that lets you capture HD videos and adjust their bitrate. In addition, the app suggests the content you can use as a source of inspiration for your work, so you can never run out of the ideas for your next video. HYPERSPECTIVE’s exporting capabilities, however, leave much to be desired for.

#### 6. [Glitch Wizard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-wizard-distort-photos-to-trippy-gifs/id904640439?mt=8)

![glitchwizard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchwizard-poster.png)

**Price:** $1,99

**Compatibility:** iOS

The app offers more than thirty glitches you can use to create different styles of glitch art videos. You can try out different options and once you get the result you like you can export it as a GIF or a short video. However, Glitch Wizard doesn’t offer video editing options, so there isn’t much more you can do with it other than experiment with different glitches. Even so, this app is an excellent choice for all glitch video artists in need of a creative tool that lets them produce amazing visuals effortlessly. Adding the glitchwizard hashtag to your creations can help you become one of the app’s featured artists.

#### 7. [Glitch!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucagrillo.ImageGlitcher&hl=en%5FUS)

![glitch-1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-1-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.

#### 9. [Glitch Cam – Video Effects](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-cam-video-effects/id1447083274?mt=8)

![glitchcam-videoeffects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchcam-videoeffects.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Recording glitch art masterpieces is going to become so easy if you install the Glitch Cam because this app provides you with a ridiculous amount of effects you can combine in real time. In addition to stunning glitch effects, the app is also equipped with a VHS Camcorder that lets you make vintage videos that look like they’re recorded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The best part is that you can export all your creations in full HD resolution and share them to your favorite social networks directly from the app in just a few quick taps.

#### 10. [KineMaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/)

![kinemaster-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1223932558), Android

Before you can start creating a glitch video with KineMaster, you must first install the Anaglyph Slide effect from the app’s Asset Store. Once the effect is installed, you can import the file you’d like to edit and proceed to make cuts, apply transitions or add a voiceover. When you complete all other [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) actions, you should head over to the Effects menu in order to apply the Anaglyph Slide effect to the video. You can then adjust the effect’s settings by assigning new Angle, Speed, and Distance values and that’s it you’ve created a glitch video with KineMaster.

If you are a fan of electronic, noise, and other experimental genres of music that emerged in the early and mid-1990s, then you probably already know what Glitch art is. Those of you who are a bit younger and don’t know the VJ-ing scene well, have probably encountered glitch art through music videos released by bands like The Glitch Mob or Gorrilaz. Even though intentionally creating glitches and distortions that look like they were caused by hardware malfunction used to be a complex and highly technical process, video editing apps that appeared on the market in the last couple of years have made this video technique almost automatic.

## 10 Best Glitch Art Video Editing Apps for iOS and Android-based Devices

Besides, stunning glitch art effects, nearly all apps we featured in this article are also equipped with powerful video editing tools you can use to manipulate the footage you’ve captured with your phone in any way you want. So, let’s take a look at some of the best glitch art video editing apps for iOS and Android devices.

#### 1. [GlitchFX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-video-effects-glitchfx/id1360624861?mt=8)

![glitchFX-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchFX-poster.jpg)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

Making music videos with the GlitchFX app is fun and easy since you only have to pick a video you’d like to edit from your phone’s camera roll, choose the song you’d like to use as a soundtrack, and apply a VHS, Glitch, or any other visual effect you like. The app also features Cut and Trim tools that let you remove all parts of the selected video you don’t want to include in the final cut of your glitch art video. GlicthFX’s file-sharing capabilities present you with a number of options as you can post your latest creations on Musical.ly, Facebook, YouTube, and other popular social networks directly from the app. The only downside is that you have to make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all the VHS and glitch effects the app has to offer.

#### 2. [Glitch Video Effects](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zlogic.glitchee&hl=en)

![glitch-video-effects-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-video-effects-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but contains ads

**Compatibility:** Android

If you are a fan of vaporwave aesthetics and you like making experimental mind-bending videos, then this Android-based app might be the right choice for you. The app lets you capture glitch photos and videos in real-time, so you can see how your images are going to look like even before you press the record button. There are more than a hundred trippy and glitch video effects you can choose from that enable you to recreate some vintage styles of videos or make unique videos with hallucinogenic colors. When done experimenting, you can share your Glitch art videos with your friends on social media with a single tap.

#### 3. [Groovo](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/groovo-video-effects-glitch/id1283795125?mt=8)

![groovo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/groovo.png)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzmusiq.groovo&hl=en), iOS

Groovo is a community of like-minded people where you can discover new content on a daily basis and find inspiration for your own work. This AI-powered app grants you access to huge music and visual effects libraries, which enables you to create stunning music videos effortlessly. Groovo also features basic video editing tools, so you can remove all parts of the audio or video files you don’t want to share with your friends on social media. What’s more, all the videos you create with Groovo are going to be watermark-free, but you shouldn’t expect too much from this app in terms of its video editing capabilities.

#### 4. [Glitché](https://glitche.com/)

![glitche-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitche-poster.png)

**Price:** $0,99, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner or Travis Scott are just a few among countless celebrities who are already using this app to take photos or capture videos. Glitché offers a rich selection of real-time photo and video filters you can control even while you’re still recording. There are more than 30 creative tools that let you create VHS style videos or make digital glitches in just a few simple taps, and if you want to edit your photos and videos with a more powerful software you can export your projects to Adobe Creative Cloud. However, you are going to have to make a few in-app purchases if you want to have access to all of the app’s features.

#### 5. [HYPERSPECTIVE](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/hyperspektiv/id1058051662?mt=8)

![hyperspektiv-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperspektiv-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

There is so much more you can do with this app, besides creating glitch art, because even the free version HYPERSPECTIVE offers a powerful mirroring system and a rich selection of visual effects. In order to be able to record videos for your Instagram stories, you must upgrade to the paid version of the app that lets you capture HD videos and adjust their bitrate. In addition, the app suggests the content you can use as a source of inspiration for your work, so you can never run out of the ideas for your next video. HYPERSPECTIVE’s exporting capabilities, however, leave much to be desired for.

#### 6. [Glitch Wizard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-wizard-distort-photos-to-trippy-gifs/id904640439?mt=8)

![glitchwizard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchwizard-poster.png)

**Price:** $1,99

**Compatibility:** iOS

The app offers more than thirty glitches you can use to create different styles of glitch art videos. You can try out different options and once you get the result you like you can export it as a GIF or a short video. However, Glitch Wizard doesn’t offer video editing options, so there isn’t much more you can do with it other than experiment with different glitches. Even so, this app is an excellent choice for all glitch video artists in need of a creative tool that lets them produce amazing visuals effortlessly. Adding the glitchwizard hashtag to your creations can help you become one of the app’s featured artists.

#### 7. [Glitch!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucagrillo.ImageGlitcher&hl=en%5FUS)

![glitch-1-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-1-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

Even though Glitch! is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to generate both GIF and MP4 animations. All you have to do in order to create a glitch photo is to select a picture from your phone’s gallery, upload it into the app and choose the effect you like the most. Afterward, you just have to set the X and Y values that determine how many errors your picture is going to contain and proceed to share it on social media. Keep in mind that some of the app’s advanced features have to be purchased before you can use them to create your artwork.

#### 9. [Glitch Cam – Video Effects](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-cam-video-effects/id1447083274?mt=8)

![glitchcam-videoeffects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitchcam-videoeffects.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

Recording glitch art masterpieces is going to become so easy if you install the Glitch Cam because this app provides you with a ridiculous amount of effects you can combine in real time. In addition to stunning glitch effects, the app is also equipped with a VHS Camcorder that lets you make vintage videos that look like they’re recorded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The best part is that you can export all your creations in full HD resolution and share them to your favorite social networks directly from the app in just a few quick taps.

#### 10. [KineMaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/)

![kinemaster-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-poster.png)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1223932558), Android

Before you can start creating a glitch video with KineMaster, you must first install the Anaglyph Slide effect from the app’s Asset Store. Once the effect is installed, you can import the file you’d like to edit and proceed to make cuts, apply transitions or add a voiceover. When you complete all other [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) actions, you should head over to the Effects menu in order to apply the Anaglyph Slide effect to the video. You can then adjust the effect’s settings by assigning new Angle, Speed, and Distance values and that’s it you’ve created a glitch video with KineMaster.
