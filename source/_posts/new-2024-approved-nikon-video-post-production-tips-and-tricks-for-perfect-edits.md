Here, a powerful yet easy-to-use Nikon video editor- [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is introduced. With it, you can not only finish basic video editing like trimming, cutting, splitting in a few clicks, but also add creative flourishes like titles, intro/credits, clip arts, and fair-sounding soundtracks. What's more, after editing, you can share your masterpiece directly on YouTube, burn it to DVD, or save to any formats on your computer. Now download this program and try it out.

## How to Edit Nikon Video Files

#### 1\.  Import your Nikon Video Files

First, transfer the Nikon video files to your computer. Then drag and drop them to the primary window after launching this program. All the imported files will appear as thumbnails in the left pane. You can double click a clip to preview it in the right previewing window. When everything is ready, drag and drop the videos to the Timeline to polish them as you like.

![nikon video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/full-feature-interface.jpg)

The latest version 9 of Filmora Video Editor also allows you to import video footage from your Nikon camera directly. You can click the **Import** menu first and then select **Import from a Camera or Phone** option which will enter the **Import from Device** window. You can import only videos or only images or all media files to Filmora. All the imported media will be saved under C:\\Users\\admin\\Documents\\Wondershare Filmora\\User Media\\Device Import by default. But you can always change the default path.

#### 2\.  Edit and personalize your Nikon video files instantly

This Nikon video editing software turns rather complicated video editing into a pretty easy and efficient job. Since it features Timeline based editing, you can just move the slide bar or the duration adjustment bar to the right location you want, and then do video trimming, cutting, splitting with ease. To edit video/audio, just double click the target file and adjust the playing speed, brightness, contrast, pitch, voice, etc. according to your needs.

![ Filmora 9 Remove from Background Noise ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-remove-audio-from-video.jpg)
