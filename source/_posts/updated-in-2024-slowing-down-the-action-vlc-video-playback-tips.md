## Slowing Down the Action: VLC Video Playback Tips

While the files of the most common formats like MP4, WAV, etc. may look identical, they might be compiled using varied codecs which may or may not support any random player that you install on your PC. The reason why VLC media player is used by the majority of users worldwide is the versatility in the codecs that it supports natively.

Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.

With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn **how to play slow motion on VLC** on Windows, Mac, and iOS/Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.

04 [How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Click anywhere on the screen to close the **Playback** menu, and then click the **Play** button from the bottom to resume the video playback in slow motion.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.

VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats.
