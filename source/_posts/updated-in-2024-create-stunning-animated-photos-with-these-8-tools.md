**Pros**

* The image library contains more than 6000 royalty-free images
* VideoScribe lets its users record voiceovers
* Equipped with a broad range of hand, pens and other pre-animated elements
* Excellent file-sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* VideoScribe doesn’t offer any video editing tools
* Removing watermark requires you to update to the pro version of the app

**Conclusion**

Encouraging your children to express their creativity can be beneficial for a variety of reasons. A video editing software like Filmora is one of your best choices if your child wants to create YouTube videos, while iOS and Android-based apps like Filmora or The Lego Movie 2 Movie Maker are well-suited for all children who would like to create videos from their Smartphones.
