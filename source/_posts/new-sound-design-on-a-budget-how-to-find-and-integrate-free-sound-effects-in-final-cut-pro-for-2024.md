Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?

The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.

Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.

![SoundEffect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/SoundEffect.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Different Types of Sound Effects?

Sound effects have four major types:

1. **Ambiance SFX**

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 2: How to Add Sound Effects in Final Cut Pro?

Cinematographic productions need well-balanced music and sound effects. Luckily, **Final Cut Pro comes with** built-in audio enhancement features and third-party Audio Units (AU) effects that allow users to add sound effects to their videos and manage all audio processing tasks.

You can add sound effects in your video with Final Cut Pro. Wonder how? Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Photos and Audio Sound Bar**

* In the top-left corner, there is a **Photos and Audio** Click on this button as shown in the figure below:
* Select the **Window** and **Go To** Either press Shift + Command + 1 or tap **Photos and Audio** from the dropdown menu

![sound-icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sound-icon.jpg)

**Step 2: Select the Sound Category**

* Choose a sound category or app from the Photos and Audio sidebar
* A list will appear contacting the audio clips in that specific category as shown in the figure below:
* You can find multiple music and sound clips in the Sound Effects category. The list also contains various apps you use on your Mac such as GarageBand, Music, and Logic Pro, etc.

![fcpx_sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx_sound.jpg)

**Step 3: Select the Music or Sound to be added**

* Filter the items in the browser by using the pop-up menu. Go to **Music > Purchased** or select **Sound Effects >** **Final Cut Pro Sound Effects > Impacts & Crashes.**
* Preview your selected audio file by selecting it from the list and clicking the **Play**
* If you want to select multiple items, command-click each item individually.

**Step 4: Use the Selected Music or Audio**

* Drag your selected sound clip to the timeline or the sidebar
* Once the **Photos and Audio** sidebar has been replaced by the **Libraries** sidebar, you can add the selected audio or music files to an event. The **Photos and Audio** sidebar will reappear as you drag those files.
* Play the video to make sure sound effects have been successfully added

For enhanced playback experiences, all MP audio files are automatically transcoded to MOV audio files. However, you can also find the original MP3 files in the source media files section of Final Cut Pro. Besides, by adding mono audio clips to a stereo project, only the single mono audio will be plated in both left and right channels. You can view them in the stereo audio meters of your project.

Surely you don't want to see your sound effect missing in your footage, but that happens a lot in FCPX. Just in case, you may want to see this article: [Proven Ways to Get Missing Sound Effects Back in Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: How to Improve Your Video with Sound Effects?

Add the original video to Filmora by clicking the **Import** button or directly dragging the file to the primary window

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

**Step 3: Select the Music or Sound to be added**

* Filter the items in the browser by using the pop-up menu. Go to **Music > Purchased** or select **Sound Effects >** **Final Cut Pro Sound Effects > Impacts & Crashes.**
* Preview your selected audio file by selecting it from the list and clicking the **Play**
* If you want to select multiple items, command-click each item individually.

**Step 4: Use the Selected Music or Audio**

For enhanced playback experiences, all MP audio files are automatically transcoded to MOV audio files. However, you can also find the original MP3 files in the source media files section of Final Cut Pro. Besides, by adding mono audio clips to a stereo project, only the single mono audio will be plated in both left and right channels. You can view them in the stereo audio meters of your project.

## Part 4: Where to Find Sound Effects?

Both Final Cut Pro and Wondershare Filmora have a variety of built-in sound effects. You can select and drop these effects to directly add them to your video. However, if you are searching for sound effects, given below are two methods:

1. **Self-recording**

Professional filmmakers and sound experts often record sound effects by themselves according to their requirements. For example, if they want to visualize some scene from school, they can go to an educational institution and record audio. After proper editing, these sound effects are added to the video.

1. **Online Resources**

Different websites also allow their users to download their favorite sound effects. Given below are some of the top-rated websites for downloading sound effects based on their quality, variety, and usefulness:

1. [Filmostock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.

With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn **how to play slow motion on VLC** on Windows, Mac, and iOS/Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

![play speed slow motion vlc android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-speed-slow-motion-vlc-android.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and when the **Playback speed** slider disappears, tap the screen one more time. Now, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the video playback.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

![vlc iphone playback speed slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-iphone-playback-speed-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window
3. Click **Save** to save the changes

![set vlc media player default playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-vlc-media-player-default-playback-speed.jpg)

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Mac

![change vlc media player default speed mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-vlc-media-player-default-speed-mac.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

![change media default playback speed android vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-media-default-playback-speed-android-vlc.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on iOS and iPhone

* Tap **Settings** from the Home screen, and then scroll down and tap **VLC**
* Tap **Default playback speed** from the **GENERIC** section, and then tap to select a playback speed from the available list to set it as the default.

![change default playback speed vlc iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-default-playback-speed-vlc-iphone.jpg)

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

## Top 5 Online Tone Generators

Each of the online generators listed below will enable you to **hear a pure tone, and let you adjust the tone’s frequency.** Make sure that the volume on **your headphones or the speakers is properly adjusted** to avoid damaging the equipment and your hearing.

#### 1. [Online Tone Generator](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/)

You can find a number of different options on this website that range from the Pitch Shifter that allows you to change the Pitch of the files you upload to the Online Tone Generator platform to Binaural Beats and DTMF Signals. After you land on the website’s homepage, you’ll be able to see a tone generator that lets you **select the frequency, volume and the waveform of a tone**. The frequency will be set to 44.1 kHz and the wave type will be set to **Sine by default**.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlinetonegenerator-online-tone-generator.jpg)

You can insert any frequency value you want or choose between **Sine, Square, Sawtooth and Triangle wave type options**. The volume bar lets you control how loud the tone you’re generating is. The **Play and Stop** buttons enable you to start or pause the playback whenever you want, while the **Save** button lets you **download** the tone you created.

#### 2. [Audio Test File Generators](https://www.audiocheck.net/audiofrequencysignalgenerator%5Findex.php)

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audiocheck-online-tone-genereatorso-options.jpg)

**Generating Sweep, Dual or Sine tones** with this online tool is easy, as you simply have to select the type of tone you want to generate. All sound files you can find on this platform are accurately calibrated, and you can adjust their frequency and amplitude. Clicking on any of the links available in the Tone Gen section of this website will take you to another page where you can adjust the properties of a tone before downloading it.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audiocheck-online-tone-genereatorso-sinetone.jpg)

In the upper left corner of the new webpage, you’ll be able to see the **Play** button that lets you hear the default tone you selected. Directly below you can find the File Generator option where you can adjust the properties of the tone you’re generating. The displayed options depend on the type of tone you selected. Clicking on the **Download** button will save the tone you generated to your computer, but you won’t be able to save a tone if you inserted an incorrect value into one of the boxes.

#### 3. [Szynalski Online Tone Generator](http://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/)

Making tones on this online platform doesn’t require any effort at all since you can easily control the frequency of the tone using a large slider that is displayed across the entire page. Clicking on the **Play** button will play the tone under the current settings so you can make the necessary adjustments if you’re not happy with the results you’re getting. Several options that let you fine-tune the settings of the tone you’re generating can be found below the frequency slider.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/szynalski-online-tone-generator.jpg)

The **volume and balance** are located on the right side of the screen and they allow you to determine how loud the tone is going to be or to choose to which channel the majority of the signal is going to be sent. The value in the middle of the screen displays the current frequency of the tone. The arrows also allow you to change the frequency value, while clicking on the wave type selector lets you choose between Sawtooth, Sine, Triangle, and Square options.

The tones you generate on this website **can’t be downloaded to your computer**, but you can use the **Get Link option** to send a tone to your email or to a friend.

#### 4. [Wavtones Audio Frequency Signal Generator](https://www.wavtones.com/functiongenerator.php)

The free version of this website offers only a **limited amount of tones** that have a maximum **duration of 5 seconds**. Purchasing Basic, Pro or Corporate packages will grant you access to all types of tones this online tone generator offers, and the tones you download can last up to 300 seconds depending on the sample rate.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wavtones-online-tone-generator.jpg)

The **WavtonesAudio Frequency Signal Generator** allows you to alter the properties of each tone it offers, even if you’re using the free version, but you can’t listen to any of the available tones before you download them. This makes it a bit more difficult to generate a tone in accordance with your current demands. Furthermore, the **Bit Depth** of all tones the free version of this online tone generator provides is limited to 16-bit.

#### 5. [Gieson TonGen](https://www.gieson.com/Library/projects/utilities/tonegen/)

If you are looking for an easy way to generate tones from your browser this may be one of the best options available. You can easily change the frequency of a tone by dragging the Hz slider, and the Fine Tune Hz slider enables you to find the perfect frequency of a tone.

There are **four wave types** you can choose from that generate different types of tones and you can change their tonality by clicking on one of the buttons located near the bottom of the tone generator.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gieson-tone-generator.jpg)

Saving the tones you generate is not possible as Gieson TonGen website doesn’t offer this option. Using a link to send a tone you created is also not possible. This online tone generator is a perfect option if you’re looking for a way to quickly generate a tone directly from your web browser, but it can be hardly considered a great option if you want to generate a tone for professional purposes.

## Conclusion

The scope of options different online tone generators provide can vary. That is the reason why your decision which of the tone-generating tools we covered in this article you are going to use depends on the reason why you’re creating a tone.

What is your favorite method of generating tones? Leave a comment below and let us know.
