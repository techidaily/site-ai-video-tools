**Price:** Free version available, pricing options start at $69

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The range of the file conversion options this tool provides depends on the subscription model you’ve selected. In case you choose to convert your DVDs with the free version of the software, the number of discs you can open will not be limited but you won’t have access to all conversion profiles. Furthermore, you won’t have access to 4K and  profiles and you will only get a free DVD Ripper account.

Both Full Trial and Paid versions of this DVD converter let you export multichannel audio files, but the free version limits the number of audio channels to just two. The [resolution of the output videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) cannot be higher than 480p regardless of the subscription model you choose, but you can purchase the Enlarger AI app separately and use it to upscale the videos up to 1080p.

### 6\. [WinX DVD Ripper Platinum](https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/)

**Price:** $59.95

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Backing up old DVDs, fixing playback errors on DVDs, or ripping a DVD to MP4 are some of the most common reasons why PC and Mac users choose to convert their DVDs with WinX DVD Ripper Platinum.

![winx-dvd](https://images.wondershare.com/videoconverter/article/2017/01/14852341013478.jpg)

You can also convert encrypted or regional DVDs or choose to clone DVD to ISO without any quality losses. This DVD converter also offers [simple video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you to trim videos, remove black bars, add subtitles or change the resolution of a video file. WinX DVD Ripper Platinum supports Level-3 Hardware Acceleration for Intel CPU, Nvidia or AMD GPU, so that you can convert an entire DVD into MP4 in just a few minutes.

**Conclusion**

Even though DVDs are no longer as popular as they once were, movie or music collectors can benefit from converting them to digital formats. Damaging a DVD is relatively easy, and backing up the data from your DVDs is probably the easiest way of ensuring that all your files are safe. Which DVD to digital format converter are you going to choose to convert your DVDs to digital video file format? Leave a comment and let us know.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

## Part1: The Best Video Courses For Final Cut Pro in YouTube

Finding good Final Cut Pro X tutorials on YouTube may be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Millions of videos on the internet promise to teach Final Cut tips and tricks, but only a handful of them deliver the degree of training you require.

Even if you discover competent video editing teachers on YouTube, there's a high chance they won't teach you how to use the particular program function you need. It's incredibly aggravating to spend so much time looking for what you need!

But don't lose heart just yet. You can discover a professional video editing instructor that offers a variety of free lessons, tips, and tools for beginners and professionals with a bit of assistance.

Check out our top 5 Recommendations to learn Final Cut Pro on YouTube before you waste hours scanning through dozens of videos:

It's just good, reliable information.

### 3.Marcos Rocha – A Heaven for Advanced Techniques

Having mastered the basics, let's move on to some advanced workflow ideas. It takes some time to become comfortable enough (when editing) to experiment with keyboard shortcuts and workflow shortcuts. This is the beauty of editing. Watching lessons on this channel will assist you in putting some of these advanced concepts, shortcuts, and tips into practice as they become second nature to you.

![the-best-fcpx-maroos rocha](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-3.jpg)

### 4.Brad and Donna – Game-Changing Plugins

Everyone needs and appreciates free things, whether they're new to FCPX or a professional editor. Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don't seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-brad-and-donna](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-4.jpg)

### 5.Totally Exposed – Complete Guide for Beginners

Are you new to Final Cut Pro X and don't know where to start? If you're new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-totally-exposed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-5.jpg)

When you're learning from a seasoned expert, it's easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you've never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

Are you new to Final Cut Pro X and don't know where to start? If you're new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-totally-exposed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-5.jpg)

When you're learning from a seasoned expert, it's easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you've never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-8.jpg)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

### 4.[FCPX.tv](https://fcpx.tv/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals.

Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface

* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free

### 4\. KineMaster

In the world where iPad Pro video editors rise and fall, KineMaster has survived all these years because of its powerful features and simplicity. Overall, if you are looking for a tool to edit videos on the go — you should take a serious look at KineMaster.

**Pros:**

**Price:**

* Premium Monthly — $7.99

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.
