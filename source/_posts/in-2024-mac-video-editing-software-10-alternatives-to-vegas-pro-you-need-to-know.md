## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.

So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.

![add-fire-effect-to-the-hand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/add-fire-effect-to-the-hand.jpg)

## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.

#### 1. [Merge Video](https://mergevideo.online/)

This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor)

![kapwing_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/kapwing_1.jpg)

The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.

#### 5. [Cellsea](http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor)

Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer.

## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.

The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.

Have you ever been mesmerized by a video with text or emoji’s moving together with objects? That effect is produced using motion tracking and isn’t very complicated. Today, we will introduce some text motion tracking software (free & paid) tools that allow you to pin text to video with minimum effort. There will also be detailed tutorials on how to utilize each tool. Let’s get started.

## Best Text Motion Tracking Software \[+Howtos\]

**Note:** The list below is in no particular order.

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Pricing:** Free (watermark) /starts at $49.99/year

**Operating System:**  Windows & Mac

The newly released Wondershare Filmora X version has added the motion tracking features, which allows you to track moving objects in a video clip, and attach images, texts, elements and videos to follow the movement path.

#### How to Use Filmora Video Editor To Do Text Motion Tracking?

* Import the video footage to the timeline and then click the Motion Track icon in the tool bar to enable the Motion Tracking option.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motion-tracking-tool-bar.jpg)

* In the preview window, drag and adjust the tracking box to select a moving object as the target.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-motion-tracking-box.jpg)

* Click the Start Tracking menu to start the moton tracking render, and Filmora video editor will compute the moving path automatically
* Now, go to the Titles tab and drag a subtitle, titles, lower 3rd, or callout to the track just above the motion-tracked video. Customize your texts, adjust its size, position, etc. in the preview window.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  - Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motion-tracking-text.jpg)

* Next, double click the video footage to enter the Motion Track option. Select the title as a follower. Playback the video, and you will see the text will move accordingly.

Below is a step by step video tutorial about how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora. Keep watching.

### 2. Premiere Pro CC

**Pricing:** 14-day trial, minimum $20.99/month

**Operating System:** Windows, Mac

Adobe Premiere Pro is an industry-leading video editor. Premiere Pro CC has all the editing tools a pro video editor needs.

There is no automatic tracking feature in Premiere Pro to pin text to video. Therefore, you need to manually position your text and add keyframes frame by frame. But the overall effort required and the final result isn’t much different from traditional editors.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Premiere Pro CC? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video to the timeline
* Add text by Pressing ‘T’ on your keyboard and clicking on the preview window (your footage)
* Change the position & duration of the text layer on the timeline according to the position & duration of motion tracking
* Make sure you’re on the frame you want to start tracking from
* Click on your text layer → then go to effects controls
* Change the position of the text to the point you want to track → click on the stopwatch icon to add a keyframe
* Move a few frames forward → adjust the position again → add another keyframe
* Don’t put the keyframes too close or too farther apart
* Play through to check it out → adjust the position and number of keyframes if any issues arise

The whole process is relatively easy, although tedious. But the process becomes very complicated when you have more dynamic motion in your clip

### 3. After Effects

**Pricing:** 7-day trial, $20.99/month (individual)

 **Operating System:** Windows & Mac

Adobe After Effects is an editor that focuses on animation & creative composition. This app has been developed as a companion to Premiere Pro for creating short & flashy motion graphics and visual effects for projects.

Motion tracking in After Effects can be done using the Point Tracker, which has one-point and up to four-point tracking. Other tracking options include the built-in 3D Camera Tracker that lets you reverse engineer a scene and the spline tracker that enables you to track masks on an object. There is also Mocha AE, a planar tracker from BorisFX. The Point Tracker is the most flexible and versatile in After Effects. We’ll use it to pin text to video.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? \[Main Steps\]

* Create a new composition/open an old one and make sure your clip is imported
* Create a null object by right-clicking on the window (screenshot below)
* Select your clip → click on tracker → click on track motion
* Two square boxes will appear
* Move the squares to the point you want to track (make sure to select an object with relatively high contrast for easier tracking)
* Position the smaller square on the object you want to track
* Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame
* Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)
* If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on
* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.

* Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame
* Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)
* If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on
* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.
