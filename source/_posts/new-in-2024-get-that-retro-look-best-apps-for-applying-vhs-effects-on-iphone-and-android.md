## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take â€“** Donâ€™t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more â€“** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Donâ€™t improvise, make a script â€“** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what youâ€™re good at â€“** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, donâ€™t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Donâ€™t forget your audience â€“** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they donâ€™t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 2: What should be included in a video resume?

In essence, there is no difference between a video resume and a paper resume, which are means of obtaining an interview. So, in the video resume, the following information should be included as well:

**Education background:** When recording video resumes, briefly introduce the educational experience and qualifications, the majors and graduates, and the specific skills and abilities if necessary.

**Work experience:** Focus on past jobs and positions and achievements.

**Training experience:** What kind of skills training did you participate in, and what benefits do you get from it?

**Job intention:** which position youâ€™re applying for, and why do you want to this job. You can state it from your majors and your future career plans.

**Concluding remarks:**  you can end your resume recording with sentences like Thank you for watching my resume and looking forward to the opportunity to get an interview.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take â€“** Donâ€™t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more â€“** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Donâ€™t improvise, make a script â€“** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what youâ€™re good at â€“** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, donâ€™t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Donâ€™t forget your audience â€“** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they donâ€™t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.
