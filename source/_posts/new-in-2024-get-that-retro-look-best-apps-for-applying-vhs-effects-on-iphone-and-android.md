## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

Filmora has huge   **visual effects, music and sound effects libraries**  you can use on all projects you edit with this software. Besides the video effects pre-programmed in the video editor, you can also download and use some video effects, especially for businesses to make the video resume more professional. What’s more, you can export all your videos to your YouTube channel directly from Filmora and save time on uploading your video resume and all other videos you create with this software to the Internet.

## Part 2: What should be included in a video resume?

In essence, there is no difference between a video resume and a paper resume, which are means of obtaining an interview. So, in the video resume, the following information should be included as well:

**Education background:** When recording video resumes, briefly introduce the educational experience and qualifications, the majors and graduates, and the specific skills and abilities if necessary.

**Work experience:** Focus on past jobs and positions and achievements.

**Training experience:** What kind of skills training did you participate in, and what benefits do you get from it?

**Job intention:** which position you’re applying for, and why do you want to this job. You can state it from your majors and your future career plans.

**Concluding remarks:**  you can end your resume recording with sentences like Thank you for watching my resume and looking forward to the opportunity to get an interview.

## Part 3: How to Make a video resume with Filmora?

Making videos in Filmora is easy, import your captured resume footage, do some basic editing, add some effects and titles, and save and share.

* **Import video footage or record**

![Import Video CV footage to Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-from-camera-phone-filmora9.jpg)

If you’ve recorded your resume video with your phone or camera already, you can import them to Filmora directly. Click the Import menu and then select Import from a Camera or a phone.

You can also click Import Media Files Here to import the recorded media from your computer step by step.

You can also record the video with the webcam on your computer. To do this, click the Record menu and then select Record from Webcam.

* **Add media to timeline and do some basic editing**

Drag the media files you want to edit into the timeline panel. Click the Spacebar to preview the media on timeline in the Preview window.

![  Filmora9  add video CV to timeline ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-face-change-video.jpg)

In most cases, you may need to trim, split and [cut out unwanted parts from the recorded video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) CV. All this can be done quickly in Filmora.

* **Polishing video**

If your recorded video footage is shaky, you can [stabilize it](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in Filmora with the Video Stabilization feature.

![  Filmora9 stabilize shaky video CV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-stabilization-9.jpg)

If the lighting isn’t so beautiful in recording, you can adjust the contrast, hue and temperature to [correct the color](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

* **Add titles & subtitles**

You can also [add some vital information as titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to emphasis.

![Add titles in   Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-titles-text.jpg)

Of course, you can also [add subtitles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so even when people watch your Visume in mute, you can still know what you’re talking about.

* **Save and share**

When you’re satisfied with the video and want to save it, click the Export button to save it on your computer directly.

![Export in   Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg)

There’re several [formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)available, but MP4 is highly-recommended considering the capacity.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 5: Creative Video Resumes Examples

You can find more videos about Video Resume on YouTube, and I’ve selected some creative ones so you can have a quick look.

Mark Leruste introduced himself in a joyful way. In his video, we can see there’re lots of visual effects used.

In Denny’s Video Resume, he added upbeat background music to demonstrate his experience in an upbeat atmosphere. He shared his filmmaking experience, editing techniques, achievement, and thoughts in this 2-minute video.

Video production credits: Denny Kremblas Creative

**Conclusion**

The job market is highly competitive, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to use all means available to you to get the job you want. The video resume makers, we presented in this article, offer a wide array of tools, but it is up to you to find a way to use these tools creatively.
