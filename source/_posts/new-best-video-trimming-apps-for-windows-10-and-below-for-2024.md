## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

![Change M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2021.png)

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

![Create version of M4A](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2023.png)

Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the **M4A to M4R** simply by rewriting the file extension name.

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

### 05**Which Other Formats M4A Can Be Converted into and Why?**

There are numerous file formats that you can convert M4A into. If you want examples: you can **convert M4A to M4R**, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such **M4A converter** that we recommend is Filmora Pro!

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is an all-in-one video editing software that will allow you to **convert M4A to M4R** (and all sorts of other audio and video file formats) so that you can make use of the file for all your projects!

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

![Change M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2021.png)

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

![Add File to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2022.png)

****Step 2: Create to M4R!**

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

![Create version of M4A](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2023.png)

****Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R**

Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the **M4A to M4R** simply by rewriting the file extension name.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2024.png)

### 03**How to Convert M4A to M4R Online**

For this next part, we'll be echoing another one of our earlier tutorials! Only, this time, we'll be focusing on converting **M4A to M4R online** with an **M4R converter online**! Specifically, the one we introduced previously — Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Online M4R Converter**

Audio Tool Set offers an **M4A to M4R** converter that you can select under the 'CONVERT AUDIO' tab!

![Audio Tool Set - M4A to M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2025.png)

****Step 2: Upload M4A File!**

Once you've been moved to the free **M4A to M4R** converter, select the 'UPLOAD M4A' option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.

![Upload M4A file for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2026.png)

****Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!**

If you're using the **M4A to M4R Converter** you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen 'M4R' as your desired conversion format!

![Confirm M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2027.png)

****Step 4: Convert M4A to M4R!**

With all of that in order, select 'CONVERT' to move forward.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2028.png)

****Step 5: Download Converted M4R!**

Finally, with the conversion done, you can now download the converted file to use as you will! This can be done by selecting the 'DOWNLOAD' option!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2029.png)

### 04**How to Create and How to Open an M4A File?**

If you want detailed instructions on how to create an M4A file, please refer to Part 2, Section 2 of this article, or Part 3, Section 2\. In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the 'Create Version' feature that iTunes offers.

### 05**Which Other Formats M4A Can Be Converted into and Why?**

There are numerous file formats that you can convert M4A into. If you want examples: you can **convert M4A to M4R**, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such **M4A converter** that we recommend is Filmora Pro!

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

![Change M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2021.png)

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

![Add File to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2022.png)

****Step 2: Create to M4R!**

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

![Create version of M4A](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2023.png)

****Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R**

Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the **M4A to M4R** simply by rewriting the file extension name.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2024.png)

### 03**How to Convert M4A to M4R Online**

For this next part, we'll be echoing another one of our earlier tutorials! Only, this time, we'll be focusing on converting **M4A to M4R online** with an **M4R converter online**! Specifically, the one we introduced previously — Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Online M4R Converter**

Audio Tool Set offers an **M4A to M4R** converter that you can select under the 'CONVERT AUDIO' tab!

![Audio Tool Set - M4A to M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2025.png)

****Step 2: Upload M4A File!**

Once you've been moved to the free **M4A to M4R** converter, select the 'UPLOAD M4A' option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.

![Upload M4A file for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2026.png)

****Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!**

If you're using the **M4A to M4R Converter** you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen 'M4R' as your desired conversion format!

![Confirm M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2027.png)

****Step 4: Convert M4A to M4R!**

With all of that in order, select 'CONVERT' to move forward.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2028.png)

****Step 5: Download Converted M4R!**

Finally, with the conversion done, you can now download the converted file to use as you will! This can be done by selecting the 'DOWNLOAD' option!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2029.png)

### 04**How to Create and How to Open an M4A File?**

If you want detailed instructions on how to create an M4A file, please refer to Part 2, Section 2 of this article, or Part 3, Section 2\. In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the 'Create Version' feature that iTunes offers.

In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!

![iTunes Software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2030.png)

### 05**Which Other Formats M4A Can Be Converted into and Why?**

There are numerous file formats that you can convert M4A into. If you want examples: you can **convert M4A to M4R**, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such **M4A converter** that we recommend is Filmora Pro!

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is an all-in-one video editing software that will allow you to **convert M4A to M4R** (and all sorts of other audio and video file formats) so that you can make use of the file for all your projects! The best part of using a video editor like Filmora, of course, is that once you've converted the file, you can use it immediately — there's no need to wait, you can finish your project right then and there, making it unnecessary for you to go searching for any other solution.

Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!

As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of **converting text to MP3** format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)

#### In this article

01 [What is TTS?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?](#Part 2)

03 [Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is TTS?**

What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.

More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert **text to MP3 with natural voices**.

### 01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?

**Text-to-Speech human voice converter**s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!

![Online TTS (Text-to-Speech) Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-1.png)

### 02Benefits of Free Online Text to Speech Readers

The benefit of FREE online **text-to-speech human voice converter**s is exactly because they are free. Getting a live voice actor to **convert text to MP3** for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.

In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).

![Text-to-Speech Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-2.png)

### 03Features of Text to Mp3 Converter

There are lots of text-to-speech converters out there. And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to **convert text to MP3** we recommend considering the following:

**●** **Converting Time**: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.

**●** **Sound Quality**: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.

**●** **Multi-Language Support**: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.

**●** **Voice-Control Options**: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.

![Online Text-to-MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-3.png)

## Part 2 **How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?**

For the next part of this article, we’ll be teaching you how to actually get **from text to speech (MP3)** with the use of a TTS converter. Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:

### 014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?

First, for the promised tutorial! Most **text-to-human voice converter**s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):

**Step 1: Upload Text**

First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!

Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy & paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.

![Upload or Copy & Paste Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-4.png)

**Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!**

Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.

Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)

![Set Voice Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-5.png)

**Step 3: Reader Controls!**

Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.

More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!

![Adjust Speech Controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-6.png)

**Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!**

Now is finally the time to **convert text to MP3** format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).

![Convert Text to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-7.png)

### 02What is the Best Free Text to Speech Software?

To finish off this section, we introduce the tool we used for our examples! It’s the online **text to human voice converter**, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!

![NaturalReaders Landing Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-8.png)

## Part 3 **Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3**

The tutorial in the previous section was really more for the sake of ensuring that you have the basics down and that you are familiar with how these text-to-speech converters usually work. In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”

OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these **text-to-human voice converters** to the fullest!

**Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!**

Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor/actress.

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png)

**Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!**

If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.

![Language and Regions Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png)

**Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!**

The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium **text-to-human voice converters** offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.

![TTS Voices Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png)

**Tip 4: Audio Settings!**

This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your **content from text to speech (MP3)**. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.

![TTS Audio Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png)

**Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!**

Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!

![TTS Voice Speed Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png)

**Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch**

To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.

![Voice Pitch Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png)

**Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!**

Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects!

Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!

As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of **converting text to MP3** format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)

#### In this article

01 [What is TTS?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?](#Part 2)

03 [Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is TTS?**

What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.

More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert **text to MP3 with natural voices**.

### 01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?

**Text-to-Speech human voice converter**s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!

![Online TTS (Text-to-Speech) Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-1.png)

### 02Benefits of Free Online Text to Speech Readers

The benefit of FREE online **text-to-speech human voice converter**s is exactly because they are free. Getting a live voice actor to **convert text to MP3** for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.

In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).

![Text-to-Speech Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-2.png)

### 03Features of Text to Mp3 Converter

There are lots of text-to-speech converters out there. And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to **convert text to MP3** we recommend considering the following:

**●** **Converting Time**: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.

**●** **Sound Quality**: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.

**●** **Multi-Language Support**: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.

**●** **Voice-Control Options**: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.

![Online Text-to-MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-3.png)

## Part 2 **How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?**

For the next part of this article, we’ll be teaching you how to actually get **from text to speech (MP3)** with the use of a TTS converter. Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:

### 014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?

First, for the promised tutorial! Most **text-to-human voice converter**s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):

**Step 1: Upload Text**

First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!

Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy & paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.

![Upload or Copy & Paste Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-4.png)

**Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!**

Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.

Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)

![Set Voice Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-5.png)

**Step 3: Reader Controls!**

Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.

More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!

![Adjust Speech Controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-6.png)

**Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!**

Now is finally the time to **convert text to MP3** format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).

![Convert Text to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-7.png)

### 02What is the Best Free Text to Speech Software?

To finish off this section, we introduce the tool we used for our examples! It’s the online **text to human voice converter**, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!

## Part 3 **Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3**

The tutorial in the previous section was really more for the sake of ensuring that you have the basics down and that you are familiar with how these text-to-speech converters usually work. In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”

OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these **text-to-human voice converters** to the fullest!

**Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!**

Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor/actress.

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png)

**Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!**

If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.

![Language and Regions Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png)

**Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!**

The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium **text-to-human voice converters** offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.

![TTS Voices Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png)

**Tip 4: Audio Settings!**

This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your **content from text to speech (MP3)**. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.

![TTS Audio Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png)

**Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!**

Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!

![TTS Voice Speed Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png)

**Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch**

To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.

![Voice Pitch Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png)

**Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!**

Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)

Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!

As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of **converting text to MP3** format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)

#### In this article

01 [What is TTS?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?](#Part 2)

03 [Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is TTS?**

What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.

More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert **text to MP3 with natural voices**.

### 01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?

**Text-to-Speech human voice converter**s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!

![Online TTS (Text-to-Speech) Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-1.png)

### 02Benefits of Free Online Text to Speech Readers

The benefit of FREE online **text-to-speech human voice converter**s is exactly because they are free. Getting a live voice actor to **convert text to MP3** for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.

In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).

### 03Features of Text to Mp3 Converter

There are lots of text-to-speech converters out there. And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to **convert text to MP3** we recommend considering the following:

**●** **Converting Time**: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.

**●** **Sound Quality**: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.

**●** **Multi-Language Support**: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.

**●** **Voice-Control Options**: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.

![Online Text-to-MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-3.png)

## Part 2 **How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?**

For the next part of this article, we’ll be teaching you how to actually get **from text to speech (MP3)** with the use of a TTS converter. Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:

### 014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?

First, for the promised tutorial! Most **text-to-human voice converter**s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):

**Step 1: Upload Text**

First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!

Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy & paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.

![Upload or Copy & Paste Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-4.png)

**Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!**

Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.

Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)

![Set Voice Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-5.png)

**Step 3: Reader Controls!**

Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.

More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!

![Adjust Speech Controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-6.png)

**Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!**

Now is finally the time to **convert text to MP3** format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).

![Convert Text to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-7.png)

### 02What is the Best Free Text to Speech Software?

To finish off this section, we introduce the tool we used for our examples! It’s the online **text to human voice converter**, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!

![NaturalReaders Landing Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-8.png)

## Part 3 **Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3**

The tutorial in the previous section was really more for the sake of ensuring that you have the basics down and that you are familiar with how these text-to-speech converters usually work. In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”

OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these **text-to-human voice converters** to the fullest!

**Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!**

Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor/actress.

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png)

**Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!**

If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.

![Language and Regions Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png)

**Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!**

The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium **text-to-human voice converters** offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.

![TTS Voices Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png)

**Tip 4: Audio Settings!**

This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your **content from text to speech (MP3)**. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.

![TTS Audio Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png)

**Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!**

Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!

![TTS Voice Speed Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png)

**Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch**

To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.

![Voice Pitch Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png)

**Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!**

Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)

![Voice Effects Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-15.png)

**Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!**

Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!
