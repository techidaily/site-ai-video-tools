# How to Create a Picture-in-Picture Effect Using Final Cut Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Sometimes we need to show two videos together on the same screen to convey certain usage information. If you are searching for a tool to make this task possible then Final Cut Pro is the best choice for you.

This tool can help you to use the picture-in-picture effect with ease. However, the process for adding this effect cannot be completed within one r two steps.

The article below contains complete details about how to add PIP effects using Final Cut Pro. You will be glad to know that FCP also works with few integrated plugins that assist in the free picture in picture effect generation.

## How to Create PIP Effect with FCP

If you are ready with two videos and now want to bring them to the same screen then prefer to follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Add Background video

The very first step that you need to follow for PIP effect generation using FCP is to bring your main or background video to the timeline as a primary storyline. Once you have created the primary storyline then all videos for the PIP effect will be added to it.

![add pip video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-pip-videos-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 2: Add PIP videos

It is time to choose the higher video clip so that the PIP effect can be applied. This task can be done either by using on-screen type controls available on the viewer or you can move ahead with transform controls available on the inspector.

Note that lower clips use to stay in the background in final results whereas upper clips will appear in the foreground. By default, both clips use to have 100% full screen with 100% opaque settings.

![transform button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/transform-button-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 3: Apply PIP effect

As now you have added both videos on-screen now you have to select the higher video and then click over the rectangular transform button that is available on the lower-left corner of viewer screen. As soon as you make this selection, the icon will turn into blue color, and naturally 8 dots will appear around the selected image or video. Use any one of these dots for scaling your selection in asymmetrical order.

![adjust pip effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-pip-effect-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 4: Adjust PIP Effect

* If you want to scale this image in a symmetrical fashion then simply drag the dot to the corner from the central position.
* Now hold the option key and drag one dot to the corner. It will help you to shrink as well as to enlarge the image even without affecting its actual aspect ratio.
* Users can keep on scaling this foreground image till the time they achieve essential size.
* Now click inside your selected image and start dragging it to reach a certain specific position. You can place it anywhere on a big screen.

#### Step 5: Follow precise Adjustment

Simply select the top clip and then hit Command + 4 to open the inspector. Now click on that blue show button over your FCP screen and it will provide you complete information about the transform category of available built-in effects. If you use inspector for this task then it can help you to get very precise results for scaling needs. It assists users to manage images with accurate position and size.

![precise adjustment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/precise-adjustment-in-fcp.jpg)

#### Step 6: Apply Cross- Dissolve

* Now choose the leading edge of effect and use Command + T. It will immediately apply the default cross-dissolve option for starting clip.
* You will be glad to know that the PIP effect does not restrict users to work just upon a single image rather it can be used to process as many pictures as your project needs and that can fit inside the frame.

You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.
