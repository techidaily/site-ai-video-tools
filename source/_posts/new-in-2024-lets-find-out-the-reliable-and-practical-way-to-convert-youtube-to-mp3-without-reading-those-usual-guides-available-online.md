#### 1. Zoom, crop and pan image for video

 Download Wax and install it first. Run the software and Load Media Files by right-clicking on MediaPool panel. But this doesn't finish. To edit video, you need to drag-n-drop desired media files to the timeline. Then switch to Video Plugins to drag-n-drop Quick 3d plugin to the just added track.
