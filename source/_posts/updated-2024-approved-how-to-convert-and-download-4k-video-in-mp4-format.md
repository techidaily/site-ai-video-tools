![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-6.jpg)

Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts.

Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.
