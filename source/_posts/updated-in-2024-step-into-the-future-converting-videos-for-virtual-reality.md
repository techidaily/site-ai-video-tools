## How to Pick the Best VR Video Converters

Taking into consideration the number of **supported VR file formats**, the overall capacity of a software or the level of control over the conversion process offered by a software will help you choose the right VR video converter.

The **video editing options** or the **download features** can also be a part of the reason why you should choose one VR video converter over the other.

The **prices** for the software products that allow you to convert home videos to VR can vary and they often depend on the pricing plan you choose. However, checking if the software provides support for the VR headset you have is the most important step you need to take while deciding which VR video converter, you’re going to buy since you won’t be able to enjoy your videos in VR if the headset isn’t supported by the software.
