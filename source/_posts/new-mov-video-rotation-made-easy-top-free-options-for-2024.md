 With the rise of smartphone-captured videos, you are more likely to come across videos that were filmed sideways. This can make viewing difficult. Luckily, rotating your video is a snap if you choose one of the top 5 free MOV video rotators below.

* [Movie Rotator 2.0](#tab%5F01)
* [Video Rotator 1.0.7](#tab%5F02)
* [Rotate Video](#tab%5F03)
* [Freemake Video Converter](#tab%5F04)
* [Any Video Converter](#tab%5F05)
* [Recommended: Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](#tab%5F06)

#### [Movie Rotator 2.0](http://movierotator.com/)

 The updated version of Movie Rotator allows users to convert films and movies into portrait mode from landscape, or vice versa. It's perfect for moving MOV file formats onto your hand held devices so you can watch films there in comfort. Movie Rotator 2.0 is specifically for those that have upgraded their operating systems to Windows 7 or 8\. If you are still using XP or Vista you should stick to the old version.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/movie-rotator.jpg "free mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* Supported video formats are limited;
* Only available for Windows 7 and 8.

#### [Video Rotator 1.0.7](http://www.videorotator.com/index.html)

 This rotator can literally move your move upside down, at 90 degrees, or turn it into a film like you are looking at it in a mirror. It supports a whole lot more formats than Movie Rotator and can even support the iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad as well as the usual MOV, MP4 and WMV file formats. Video Rotator 1.0.7 can even supports mass flipping of videos, so if you have around 50 or more to do, it'll rotate them all.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-rotator.jpg "free mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Straightforward and easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* Crashed occasionally.

#### [Rotate Video](http://www.rotatevideo.org/)

 What we liked about Rotate Video was the ability to rotate at just about any angle, with one simple click of your mouse. It supports all the major file formats including MPG, WMV or MP4 to name a few and it is remarkably simple to use. The only drawback we found was the 5MB limit on file size!

![free video roator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/rotate-video.jpg "free video roator")

**Pros:**

* Supported various video formats;
* No need to download.

**Cons:**

* 5MB limit on file size.

#### [Freemake Video Converter](http://www.freemake.com/)

 This is a very easy piece of software to use and enables anyone to easily change the rotation of your movies. It supports various video formats like MOV, AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, 3GP and more. Once you get going it's easy to use, straightforward and uncomplicated.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/freemake.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Different video editing options;
* User-friendly interface and easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* There is a charge to upgrade it to the Gold Version.

#### [Any Video Converter](http://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for%5Fvideo%5Ffree/)

 Very easy to use and a simple interface, this software does more than simply rotate your videos. It will also rotate in batches and allow you to do some smart editing like trimming, cropping, clipping as well as rotating. It's a bit of all-singing, all-dancing rotating software as it also supports a huge amount of file formats, including MOV of course.

![top mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/any-video-converter.jpg "top mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Supports almost any video formats;
* Different video editing functions.

**Cons:**

* Can’t convert audio files.

#### Recommended: Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)

 If need more video editing functions besides rotation, [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can help. This video editing tool enables you to easily crop, rotate, split, combine videos as well as add special video effects in minutes. Download and try it out.

 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

![PS4 DualShock 4 Controller](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-dualshock-4-controller.jpg)

### 1 Upload Screenshots

 Go back to the Share’s interface and select _Upload Screenshot_. Simply browse through the screenshot that you’ll like to share or upload and then click once to select it. You can also hit _Options_ instead to preview the details of the screenshot before.

![PS4 share options](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-share-options.jpg)

### 2 Share to Facebook or Twitter

 You can choose to share your screenshots online through Facebook or Twitter. Please take note that you will have to log-in to your Facebook or Twitter account prior to uploading your screenshots and be prompted with a message to give your permission. You’ll only have to go through this once.

![PS4 upload screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-upload-screenshot.jpg)

### 3 Insert Comment

 Select either one account to share your captured screenshots and before you proceed with the _Share_ button, Name it as well as type in whatever comments you have. Now you’re ready to go!

![PS4 upload screenshot Twitter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-upload-screenshot-twitter.jpg)

## Use third party software for screenshot sharing

 You can also share your PS4 captured screenshots on a separate platform such as the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can easily drag-and-drop your screenshots on the interface, stitch, personalize with effects and even insert your favorite track as the background music.

 Other than that, you can also convert your screenshots to a file format that’s compatible with your portable device; uploading onto YouTube (with additional options to share on Twitter as well as Facebook); burn your own DVD and much more. Download the trial version and try it out right now.
