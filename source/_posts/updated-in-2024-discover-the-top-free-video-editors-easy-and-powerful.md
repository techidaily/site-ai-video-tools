If you are already familiar with video making, you would know basic editing tasks like trim, crop, transitions, filters, and so on. Ever knew the term **J-Cuts**, and **L-Cuts**?

It could be surprising, but yes, your well-known Final Cut Pro X has this powerful feature still overlooked by many people. So, today, we take it on hand and shall share what L-Cuts and J-Cuts mean. You will be able to create it on your own by the end of this article.

## Part 1: The Use of L-Cuts and J-Cuts in Video Editing

Ordinary images, text, subtitles, and GIF doesn’t work anymore to get followers or likes on a video on YouTube channel or Instagram. Thus, video creators are tired of trying the same filters, transitions on the video editor tool. To create amazing videos like the ones played on your television and favorite movies, all you need is the split edit type techniques, a powerful editing tool used by professional editors. Although called professional, it isn’t difficult for a beginner if you know J-Cuts and L-Cuts.

They are nothing but the transition between the video and audio at different times and are entirely separate from wipes and fades. Such video editing technique helps in maintaining visual continuity. These super basic cuts are a combination of dialogue and imagery, thus keeping the video flow without a monotonous feeling.

When you look at the above interface, you will see the basic phenomenon behind the two split cuts. In L-Cuts, although the first video ends, the audio continues to clip two as well.

Then, **what is a J cut in Final Cut Pro**? It is ultimately reverse or opposite of L-Cuts. Yes, the second clip's audio starts a while before the scene of the first video ends.

## Part 2: Step-by-step Guide on Using L-Cuts and J-Cuts in Final Cut Pro X

As Final Cut Pro X comes overloaded with advanced, powerful tools, you can find it a little tricky. Hence, we are here to help you perform **the Final Cut Pro L-Cuts** in this session. And, yes, the **Final Cut Pro J-Cuts** as well.

**Step 1: Import media files**

Once you launch Final Cut Pro X on your Mac device, create a new project by tapping project under the new section of the “File” menu.

You can now import the video file to the workspace by executing “File > Export > Media” or by tapping the “Import Media” option on the welcome screen.

**Step 2: Expand audio in video**

Now, drag the videos to the timeline in the respective order, and expand or detach the video's audio on the timeline for easy or precise working.

**Step 3: Drag the second video to the left**

To create the Final Cut Pro L-Cuts, make sure that the first clip's edit point or audio fades out at the end.

Finally, drag the second clip's edit point to the left so that the video gets the audio of the first video.

L-Cuts are now in Final Cut Pro X.

**Note:** Here, the L-Cuts added video clip has no audio and has related well enough to the first video clip. If the second video has audio, it must be detached first, and then you should drag the edit point.

**Step 4: Final Cut Pro J-Cuts**

In the case of Final Cut Pro **J-Cuts**, the process is reverse, where you need to detach the audio of the preceding or following video clip and drag the first video to the right.

When you look at the transition closely, you can see that it resembles the letter J.

## Part 3: Final Cut Pro X Keyboard Shortcuts for L-Cuts and J-Cuts

Final Cut Pro X offers specific keyword shorts to perform Final Cut Pro L-Cuts and Final Cut Pro J-Cuts.

1\. As the first step, trim the clips shorter to get the media handles. To detach audio from the video clip, you need to press “Ctrl + S” which will expand the audio.

2\. Now, move or place the playhead at the endpoint of both the video clips where here are the keyboard shortcuts:

* To shift the playhead to the earlier edit point: press “**Semicolon (;) or up arrow key**”.
* To move the playhead to the next edit point: press “**Apostrophe (‘) or down arrow key**”.

3\. To choose the audio or the video edit point, you can do one of the following:

* Press “**Shift-Backslash (\\)**” to select both sides of the audio endpoint.
* Press “**Backslash (\\)**” to pick both sides of the video endpoint.

4\. Here is the actual process or the keyboard shortcut that helps accomplish final **cut pro-L-cuts** or **final cut pro-J-cuts** by nudging the edit points.

* To nudge or push the edit point to the left or right: press “**Comma (,) or period (.)**”.
* To move the edit point to the left or right with ten frames: press “**Shift-Comma (,) or Sift-Period (.)**”.
* Using timecode to add or subtract the present edit: press the “**Plus (+)**” or “**Minus (-)**” key with the timecode duration.

## Online video editor JayCut review

**Pros**: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.

**Cons:** If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.

**Conclusion:** Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It's fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.
