Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It’s a new and improved version of the classic Filmora video editor, with many features on par with elite video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It can be purchased for roughly $60 though a trial version is available for free.

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.

### 2. [iFlicks](https://iflicks.app/)

iFlicks is a media conversion and video metadata editor for macOS. In addition to being able to perform a variety of video format conversions, iFlicks supports detailed metadata editing and interacts seamlessly with iTunes. This app is available for a one-time fee or on a subscription basis.

## The Most Efficient Video Editing Software

If you are new to video editing and you simply want to do basic editing to your video, you need a light video editor. There is no need for a heavyweight video editor that is generally used by professionals. Besides, an industry-grade video editor demands high-end computer as they put pressure on your system resources for video processing and rendering.

Therefore, if you do not have a high-end computer for video editing, a lightweight video editor is perfect for you. There are so many lightweight video editing software applications available to choose from for video editing. We have picked the best light video editing software for smooth and satisfying video editing work.

## Part 1\. The Features for Light Video Editor

Here are the main features of a good lightweight video editor that you should be aware of.

Small File Size – A light video editor comes in a small size file, and you will understand the file size when you download it on your computer. Ideally, a light video editor should not be above a couple of hundred MBs in size.

Wide OS Compatibility – A good light video editor should not only be compatible with the latest version of computer operating system but also with older versions. This is because older operating systems fail to run a heavyweight video editor smoothly.

Low System Requirements – Every video editor lists out their system requirements starting from processor version to RAM capacity and free disk space. A light video editor should have low system requirements such as 4GB RAM, 5GB free disk space, Intel i3 or likewise.

Low CPU Usage – How much CPU resource a video editor uses determines whether the video editor is truly lightweight. You can monitor how much CPU resource an application is using from Task Manager. For a light video editor, it should never be more than 33% of the total CPU usage at any given time.

Faster Processing – A lightweight video editor is generally faster in processing and rendering videos. They use different techniques such as compression, background processing and proxy workflow to boost processing speed without affecting system performance.

## Part 2\. Best Light Video Editors
