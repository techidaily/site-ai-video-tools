## 8 Best Free Online Video Stabilizers

Even though fixing shaky footage is possible, you shouldn't expect miracles because if your footage contains too many cameras shakes these online video stabilizers won't be able to produce perfectly stable footage in every shot. On the other hand, if your video clips contain only a moderate amount of shaky footage the following video stabilizers will help you create smooth videos.

Let's have a look at how you can stabilize your videos with these free online video stabilizers.

#### 1. [EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer](https://ezgif.com/video-stabilizer)

![video stabilization online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezgif.jpg)

Besides offering a quick and easy way to stabilize video clips, EZGIF platform also lets you crop, resize or rotate videos. In addition, you can also cut videos, change their playback speed or add subtitles. You simply have to upload a video file to the platform, but you have to keep in mind that EZGIF only lets you upload files smaller than 120 MB.

You don't have to worry about the video's format, because the platform supports nearly all popular file formats like MP4, AVI, or MPEG. Here's how you can stabilize your video with EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer.

**Step 1:** Once you open the Video Stabilizer option, you will be asked to either upload the video you'd like to stabilize from the hard drive on your computer or paste the video's URL if the clip you want to stabilize is stored online. Hit the Upload Video button after you perform either of these actions and wait for the upload process to be finalized.

**Step 2:** To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you're stabilizing.

**Step 3:** Once the process is complete your video will appear in the Stabilized Video box, where you can preview it before downloading it as an MP4 file to your computer. You must click on the Save icon below the video to start the downloading the video.

#### 2. Video Stabilize

![online video stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-stabilize.jpg)

To make things even better, the platform supports all common file formats such as MOV or MP4, so you don't have to waste time trying to change the video's file format before you start the video stabilization process.

**Step 1:** Upon arriving at video-stabilize.com, you can simply drag and drop the video file to the designated box. Alternatively, you can click on the Upload your movie button or you can upload the video using Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive. Simply select the file you want to stabilize and the upload process will begin automatically.

**Step 2:** The size of the video clip and the speed of your Internet connection determines how long the upload is going to last. Once your video is uploaded you should simply click on the Transform Video to start the process of stabilizing your video.
