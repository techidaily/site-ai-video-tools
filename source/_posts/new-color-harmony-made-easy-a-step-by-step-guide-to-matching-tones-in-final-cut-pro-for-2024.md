If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.

## Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide

Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.

**Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool**

To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:

_Step 1: Load and import the video clips_

To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File > Import > Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.

_Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect_

Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify > Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.

Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.

From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.

**Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually**

Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.

Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser > Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.

## Part 2: Wondershare Filmora: The Best Alternative to FCPX Color Match Tool

Therefore, you can also take the assistance of [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Smooth Operator: Removing Camera Shake in After Effects

##### Stabilize Shaky Videos After Recording Easily

Wondershare Filmora is one of the [most popular video editing software among YouTubers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which provides the video stabilization tool to remove shake from videos within one-click. Download and have a try now.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.

Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it's usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it's not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it's too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use **After Effects to** **stabilize footage**? Let's find out!

#### In this article

01 [Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE](#part1)

02 [Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE](#part2)

03 [Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE](#part3)

## Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE

The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect's essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.

**Step 1:** The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects & Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for "**Warp**" in the search box.

![after effects effects presets pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** When you've identified **Warp Stabilizer**, you'll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.

![after effects warp stabilizer vfx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.

(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).

**Step 4:** After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.

## Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE

Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.

**Step 1:** The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn't, go to **Window** in the top menu to open it. Once you've arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate **Tracker** and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.

![after effects tracker pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You'll see that a tracker box appears in your **Layer Panel** once you've done this.

(**Note**: You'll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We're monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator's drone in the instance below).

![after effects tracker track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg)

**Step 3**: Let's press the **Play** button on the tracker panel once we've set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.

(**Note**: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the **Pause** button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).

![adobe effects track motion effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg)

**Step 4:** When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click **Edit target** to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the **Apply** option.

(**Note** A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you'll want to choose **X and Y** here).

![edit target track motion feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-target-track-motion-feature.jpg)

Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you're back in the composition window. When you're not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn't go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.

## Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE

As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, [After Effects plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.

However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.

It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:

### 1\. [Orb](https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/)

Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's outstanding Element 3D plugin.

You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you're done! Getting a world to 'look' properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.

For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?

Although Orb doesn't work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.

### 2\. [**Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)**](http://richardrosenman.com/shop/dof-pro-ae/)

Richard Rosenman's renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry's professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.

This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005\. DOF PRO's cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry's most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.

Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.

There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects' Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.

### 3\. [ReelSteady](https://www.reelsteady.com/)

ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects' warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.

ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.

In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.

The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You'll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to "iron out" sections of the footage.

You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You'll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.

ReelSteady's sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.

**Conclusion**

Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it's done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.

However, occasionally those tools aren't available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use **After Effects to** **stabilize videos** to enhance their video content!

Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.

Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it's usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it's not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it's too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use **After Effects to** **stabilize footage**? Let's find out!

03 [Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE](#part3)

## Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE

The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect's essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.

**Step 1:** The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects & Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for "**Warp**" in the search box.

![after effects effects presets pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** When you've identified **Warp Stabilizer**, you'll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.

![after effects warp stabilizer vfx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.

(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).

**Step 4:** After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.

## Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE

Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.

**Step 1:** The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn't, go to **Window** in the top menu to open it. Once you've arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate **Tracker** and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.

![after effects tracker pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You'll see that a tracker box appears in your **Layer Panel** once you've done this.

(**Note**: You'll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We're monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator's drone in the instance below).

![after effects tracker track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg)

**Step 3**: Let's press the **Play** button on the tracker panel once we've set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.

(**Note**: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the **Pause** button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).

![adobe effects track motion effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg)

**Step 4:** When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click **Edit target** to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the **Apply** option.

(**Note** A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you'll want to choose **X and Y** here).

![edit target track motion feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-target-track-motion-feature.jpg)

Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you're back in the composition window. When you're not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn't go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.

## Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE

As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, [After Effects plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.

However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.

It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:

### 1\. [Orb](https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/)

Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's outstanding Element 3D plugin.

You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you're done! Getting a world to 'look' properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.

For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?

Although Orb doesn't work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.

In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching.

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film.

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

Here’s how you can add a cinematic look to your footage with Filmora.

1, choose **Effect**
