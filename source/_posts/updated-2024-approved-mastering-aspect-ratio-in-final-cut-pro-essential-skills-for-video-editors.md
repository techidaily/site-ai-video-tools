Solution 2: Another alternate solution to overcome the above problem is that you must disclose the Video inspector in your Final Cut Pro application. Then, in the ‘Anamorphic Override’ settings change the value to Standard instead of the none or widescreen mode. By altering this value, you can get the desired outcomes without any hesitation.

When you struggle to change the aspect ratio in your videos using the Final Cut Pro app, you must look for alternative solutions to fix them.

## What is the common aspect ratio of videos?

The allowable aspect ratio for the videos and images differs with the social media platforms. In the case of the Facebook cover photo, the image size varies with desktop and mobile view. You can go for a horizontal frame with an aspect ratio of 16:9\. Here, the width is wider than height.

For Twitter and Facebook posts, set the aspect ratio for the media files to 1200 x 675 pixels. In other terms 16:9, again it looks more or like a horizontal frame. In the YouTube platform, the permitted channel art size is 2560 x 1440 and the thumbnail is 1280 x 720.

The Instagram and Pinterest pins opt for square type video frames like 1200 X 1200 pixels or 500 X 500 pixels. The latter value holds good to set profile pictures for your account. The YouTube channel icon must be 800 X 800 in a square frame to enhance visibility.

![common-aspect-ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

The Instagram posts allow the tallest media files like 1080 X 1350\. The Snapchat and TikTok go with 1080 X 1920 values. You can find the long Pinterest carrying posts measuring 1000 X 2100\. Though this platform does not recommend this size, still the posts are successfully uploaded in this dimension flawlessly.

It is highly recommended to follow the above-discussed guidelines to post the favorite videos on the relevant social media platform without witnessing any compatibility issues. These are the common aspect ratio dimensions supported by the respective platforms. While posting the media files in this environment, you must abide by its standards to get rid of unwanted uploading issues. In certain digital spaces, you may not know the reason for the failure in uploading the image or videos. In those scenarios, read the guidelines provided by that platform and modify the media file dimension according to those values and then try uploading it again. Most video upload failure happens due to the incompatibility of the media file sizes. Watch the dimensions before posting or uploading any media files in the online space.

Most social media platform allows both landscape and portrait video sizes optimally. You can switch to any size format as per your comfort. When you upload larger images or videos either you will receive an error message or it forces you to crop the content to fit perfectly with their guidelines. To overcome such a situation, you can check out the permittable file size before uploading the media files into its environment.

## Conclusion

Therefore, you had a better understanding of how to change the aspect ratio using the Final Cut Pro program. You can follow the above-discussed instructions and carry out the task as per your needs.

A short synopsis of the common media file sizes permitted on social media platforms has been listed out in this article and these enlightening facts help you to get rid of file size compatibility issues. Overcome the challenges in modifying the rigid file sizes of the videos using the forceful altering options. Connect with this article to discover exciting performances of the Final Cut Pro tool and its potential utilization in editing a media file.

We add text titles to our projects to tell the audience something they can't figure out on their own, such as the title of our program, the name of the person speaking, or technical details about a subject.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.

#### DEFINITIONS

Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:

* Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.
* Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called "supers" or "keys."
* Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.
* Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the "lower-third" of the screen.
* Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.

#### JUST THE BASICS

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg)

I'd like to introduce "Yertle," he's a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

We add text titles to our projects to tell the audience something they can't figure out on their own, such as the title of our program, the name of the person speaking, or technical details about a subject.

Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.

#### DEFINITIONS

Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:

* Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.
* Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called "supers" or "keys."
* Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.
* Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the "lower-third" of the screen.
* Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.

#### JUST THE BASICS

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg)

I'd like to introduce "Yertle," he's a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

#### In this article

01 [What is HD Video?](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?](#Part 2)

03 [Video Resolution and Corresponding File Sizes?](#Part 3)

04 [Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?](#Part 4)

05 [Is HD 2K or 1K?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Change Video Resolution Easily?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

![Resolution Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-3.jpg)

## Part 6 How to Change Video Resolution Easily?

Sometimes, you need to change the video resolutions due to different circumstances. For instance, when you upload videos from a system to the smartphone, the resolution needs to decrease. Because some devices may support specific video resolutions only.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.
