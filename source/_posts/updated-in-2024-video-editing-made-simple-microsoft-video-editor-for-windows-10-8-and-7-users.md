To edit and enhance videos in Windows-based PC, Windows Movie Maker has always been touted as the default Microsoft Video Editor, although it has been discontinued by Microsoft on Janauary 10, 2017 and replaced by [Windows Story Remix (only for Windows 8/10)](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/), you can still download it on many platforms. However, you may often fail to import their video clips because it only supports WMV ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\. Plus, the transitions and effects provided are quite limited, nothing fancy. If this is the case, you'll find a great microsoft video editing software here.

#### 3. Special Effects and Transitions

50+ ready-to-use filter effects are offered. These effects are applied by using a drag and drop interface from the **effects or transitions** folders. Besides, **Titles, Intro/Credits, PIPs** can be added as standalone ones or overlaying them on the clip by adding them onto the selected clip. For advanced users, you can also achieve **picture-in-picture** (image/video overlay) tracks and customize with motion, effects and mask.
