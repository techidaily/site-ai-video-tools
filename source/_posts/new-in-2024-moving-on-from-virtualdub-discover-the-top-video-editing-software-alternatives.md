Because of its ability to do quick linear operations on videos, VirtualDub mp4 has become a popular choice for many people throughout the globe.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices. While you can directly install Videoleap on your iPhone or Android phone by visiting its App/Play Store page, you won’t find its desktop application. That’s why a lot of people find it hard to install Videoleap on their macOS systems. Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

* [**Part 1: Major Features of Videoleap**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook**](#part3)

## Part 1: Major Features of Videoleap

You might already know that Videoleap is a popular smartphone app that is used for video editing on iOS and Android devices. It is a part of the Lightricks Creative Suite that would let you create, edit, and share your videos in one place.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

![download bluestacks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-2.jpg)

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

![download bluestacks on Mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-3.jpg)

**Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks**

Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.

![Install Videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-5.jpg)

After Videoleap is installed on BlueStacks, you can launch it, and start editing your videos without any hassle.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is one of the best video editing apps that is super-easy to use and fully supports all the major macOS versions.

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie. The video editor is developed by Apple and is already installed in leading Mac systems. While it doesn’t offer so many extensive features, iMovie would meet your basic video editing needs.

![iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-7.jpg)

On iMovie, you can find several professionally made templates that you can simply load and customize to create videos.

Once the video is loaded on its timeline, iMovie will let you perform all the basic edits such as clip, trim, crop, rotate, flip, and so on.

* _Other Features_

A few advanced features of iMovie are green screen edits, tons of transitions and filters, 4K video editing, caption effects, and other optimized features for Mac.

## Final Words

There you go! I’m sure that after following this guide, you can easily use **Videoleap for MacBook.** Since Videoleap is only available for iOS and Android devices, I have come up with a stepwise approach to install it on Mac. Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.
