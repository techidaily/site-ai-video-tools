## Part 1: Best Video Editing Apps to Edit Brightness on iPhone and Android

Brightness is important in a clip, whether you realize it or not. Viewers would not sit through a dark video in which they can't see anything. You need the right amount of brightness in your film to make it more engaging and eye-catching. And the apps we've looked at below can help you do just that.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video brightening editing tool made specifically for cellphones. It's simple to use, and even beginners can use it to edit films. Filmora enhances the video's brightness, making it crisper and more vivid.

This application's features include capturing clips, cutting them, adding background music, applying overlays and effects, and more. This popular program also supports Ultra HD resolution. Filmora includes several powerful tools that enable you to put even the most unique and creative ideas into action.

You may make movies, work on music videos, and share the finished products with your pals. This software saves you time while still providing entertainment!

To brighten a video, simply get the app on your phone and install it. Launch the app and select the "+" button to add the video you wish to modify. By clicking on the 5-second mark in the menu settings, you may alter the video's brightness. Click on the "Export" button to save the altered video for later use.

Split-screen, vintage, humorous, dreamy, party, and so on are just a few of the various effects available. Those effects add new components to your video, giving it the appearance of being professionally edited. You'll discover sub-categories of effects inside each of these categories, allowing you to fine-tune your changes to obtain the precise one that's suitable for that clip.

To brighten a video, simply tap on the "+" feature in the new Project tab. Import your video. Head over to the Edit section and apply Brightness from the Adjustment section.
