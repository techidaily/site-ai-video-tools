 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesnâ€™t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesnâ€™t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A pictureâ€™s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source youâ€™re going to use depends on the type of image youâ€™re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, youâ€™ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesnâ€™t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesnâ€™t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A pictureâ€™s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source youâ€™re going to use depends on the type of image youâ€™re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, youâ€™ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

#### **Part 1: Using Shortcut to Apply Transitions:**

![Create transitions in FCP](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-1.png)

It is possible to apply transitions with a simple shortcut; all that you need to do is either blade your video clip into several scenes as per need or add two or more different scenes to be joined to your software timeline.

It is desired because the transition effect can be applied only if you have more than one clip on the timeline. Also, you can see more [keyboard shortcuts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

![Blade your clip ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-2.png)

Once you have obtained your two scenes for which you need to add transition effect then select the very first scene from the timeline. Now open the Video animation window on your device, it can be done by pressing Shift+V; find the Compositing option, and then apply default transitions by simply dragging timeline handle towards both sides of the composite window. In FCP, Cross dissolve will be selected as the default transition.

![Default transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-3.png)

#### **Part 2: Use Browser to Apply Transition:**

* Go to the media toolbar and then hit the transition icon. It can be identified as a shaded box over which X is written.
