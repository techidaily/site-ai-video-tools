The statistics clearly indicate that video content boosts conversion rates, more than any other type of online content, which is the reason why a growing number of marketers choose to incorporate video into their social media marketing strategies. Whiteboard animations have been around since the early days of animation, but their spike in popularity coincides with the rise of digital marketing in the mid-2000s. A little over a decade later, whiteboard animations are used for a wide array of purposes that range from explainer to educational videos. We’ve combed the Internet to find the best whiteboard animation makers in 2020, so let’s dive in and see what these software products and web-based platforms have to offer.

## Top Five Hand Drawing Whiteboard Animation Makers in 2021

The so-called doodle videos are entertaining to watch because the viewer can see a hand drawing shapes or writing in front of their eyes. Creating this type of animated videos no longer requires years of training and hours of hard work, since there are countless options that enable marketers to produce whiteboard animations in just a few minutes. Here are some of the best whiteboard [animation makers online](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can find on the market in 2020.

#### 1. [Moovly](https://www.moovly.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24.92 per month billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

Moovly is much more than an online destination where you can create whiteboard animations effortlessly as it grants you access to more than a million royalty free images, videos, and sounds. The platform’s video editor lets you choose the gender of the hand that is drawing the animation or its skin color. In addition to simulating the hand drawing process of virtually any object you can think of, the Moovly’s editor also enables you to adjust the size of the elements you add to your story or incorporate handwritten text into the animation video you’re producing. The free version of the platform watermarks all videos you export and lacks any of the advanced features that are available if you opt for one of the education or subscription plans. Even so, Moovly is still one of the best web-based whiteboard animation makers you can find on the Internet because it lets you create new videos in just a few quick steps.

#### 2. [VideoScribe](https://www.videoscribe.co/en/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $25 per month for a single user

**Compatibility:** cloud-based or downloadable software for Mac and PC computers

In case you need cloud-based software you can use for free to create animations in a short period of time, then VideoScribe is probably one of the best choices you can make. The software features huge image, video and music libraries that are well-suited for a broad range of whiteboard animations, and it also offers a wide array of hands, pens, and erasers. In addition, you can import assets you’ve created and VideoScribe will animate them for you. The voiceover feature is particularly useful if you are looking to add narration to your explainer and educational videos or product reviews. VideoScribe can only be used offline if you purchase its Pro version and you won’t be able to export HD video files if you opt to create your whiteboard animations with the free version of this software. This whiteboard animation maker is an excellent option for businesses that want to improve their social media presence through the production of animated whiteboard explainer videos or educational institutions that are looking for a way to keep their students engaged.

Explaindio also lets you import your own fonts, audio files or external 3D elements and it features a timeline with multiple videos and audio tracks. What’s more, the software has a rich library of transitions you can use to avoid hard cuts between the shots or to change scenes in your whiteboard animations smoothly. Besides whiteboard animations, you can use Explaindio to animate typography, create intros and outros for YouTube videos and to make logo strings. Cloud storage is also available so that you can access your creations while you’re on the go, which is one of the reasons why more than 35.000 YouTubers, marketers, and animators are already using Explaindio.

![explaindio-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/explaindio-interface.png)

#### 4. [Doodly](https://www.doodly.com/)

**Price:** Pricing plans start at $39 per month

Doodly solves both of these issues by enabling you to simply drag and drop animated elements to the timeline and produce visually attractive hand-drawn animations at a reasonable price. The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles. The best part is that you can export all animations you create with Doodly in Full HD resolution.

Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.

The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles. The best part is that you can export all animations you create with Doodly in Full HD resolution.

#### 5. [Vyond](https://www.vyond.com/)

**Price:** 14-day free trial available, subscription plans start at $299 per year for a single user

**Compatibility:** web-based

Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.

You don’t have to be a skilled animator in order to create hand drawing whiteboard animations since each of the options we featured in this article requires a minimum amount of technical skill.

* [**Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing**](#Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Keyframing)

## Part 1: How to Make Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

To make a Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro X (or a Ken Burns Effect on Final Cut, since they are both extensions of one another) simply follow our guide.

First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!

### What is the Ken Burns Effect

[Ken Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect) is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.

The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like [wedding videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.

Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

### Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

**Step 1** – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.

![import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG)

**Step 2** – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.

**Step 4** – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.

### Ken Burns Customization

You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.

**Step 1** – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.

**Step 2** – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.

![customize ken burns effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/customize-ken-burns-effects-box.JPG)

**Step 3** – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!

**Step 4** – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing

Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves [basic animation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.

You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.

**Step 1** – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.

**Step 2** – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.

![scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg)

**Step 4** – Follow keyframe > size > position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.

**Step 5** – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.

**As a Pro Tip**: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.

## The Ken Burns Conclusion

The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.

The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.
