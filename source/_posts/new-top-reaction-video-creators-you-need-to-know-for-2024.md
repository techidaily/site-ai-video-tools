A reaction video can be any type of video in which the host reacts to [ideas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and opinions that are expressed in another video. Reacting to a video that attracts a lot of attention on the Internet might put you in the middle of the debate the video you’re commenting on is covering.

That is why you are going to need software that enables you to capture both your screen and webcam footage, as the audience needs to see the host and what he or she is reacting to. So, in this article we are going to take you through the top 5 reaction video makers you can use on PC and Mac computers.

Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.
