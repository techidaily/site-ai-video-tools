## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.
