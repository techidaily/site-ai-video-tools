In addition to excellent DVD file conversion capabilities, Uniconverter also offers VR conversion features and it allows you to [combine and merge multiple video clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Optionally, you can use this cross-platform app to [add srt and other subtitle files to the videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)you convert with it. You should keep in mind that the free version of Wondershare Uniconverter only lets you convert 1/3 of the output file and prevents recording videos that are longer than one minute.

### 4\. [DVDVideoSoft Free Video Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-DVD-Video-Converter.htm)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This is a simple tool that makes the process of converting a DVD to a digital video or audio file effortless. You just have to specify the source of the input video, then select the file format of the output video and optimize it for playback on a particular device by choosing one of the available Device presets.

You can easily convert DVDs to AVI, MP4, MKV, iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, Xbox or PS3 files with this video file converter. [Extracting audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from DVD is yet another option DVDVideo Soft Free Video Converter provides, which enables you to extract dialogue or narration from video files. Even so, the software can only convert unprotected files, so you must make sure that the DVD you are trying to convert doesn’t have regional protection or any other form of encryption.

### 5\. [DVDFab DVD Ripper](https://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-ripper.htm)

**Price:** Free version available, pricing options start at $69

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The range of the file conversion options this tool provides depends on the subscription model you’ve selected. In case you choose to convert your DVDs with the free version of the software, the number of discs you can open will not be limited but you won’t have access to all conversion profiles. Furthermore, you won’t have access to 4K and  profiles and you will only get a free DVD Ripper account.

Both Full Trial and Paid versions of this DVD converter let you export multichannel audio files, but the free version limits the number of audio channels to just two. The [resolution of the output videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) cannot be higher than 480p regardless of the subscription model you choose, but you can purchase the Enlarger AI app separately and use it to upscale the videos up to 1080p.

### 6\. [WinX DVD Ripper Platinum](https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/)

**Price:** $59.95

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Backing up old DVDs, fixing playback errors on DVDs, or ripping a DVD to MP4 are some of the most common reasons why PC and Mac users choose to convert their DVDs with WinX DVD Ripper Platinum.

![winx-dvd](https://images.wondershare.com/videoconverter/article/2017/01/14852341013478.jpg)

You can also convert encrypted or regional DVDs or choose to clone DVD to ISO without any quality losses. This DVD converter also offers [simple video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you to trim videos, remove black bars, add subtitles or change the resolution of a video file. WinX DVD Ripper Platinum supports Level-3 Hardware Acceleration for Intel CPU, Nvidia or AMD GPU, so that you can convert an entire DVD into MP4 in just a few minutes.

**Conclusion**

Even though DVDs are no longer as popular as they once were, movie or music collectors can benefit from converting them to digital formats. Damaging a DVD is relatively easy, and backing up the data from your DVDs is probably the easiest way of ensuring that all your files are safe. Which DVD to digital format converter are you going to choose to convert your DVDs to digital video file format? Leave a comment and let us know.
