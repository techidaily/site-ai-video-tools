Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame.

Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu.

You can easily take a sequence of images and make your own stop-motion video on this app. Once you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device's camera will open. Press the camera button and make a new frame.

Tap on the Done button once you are done arranging the photos.

You have the option to preview the result once you are done. Then, you can quickly proceed to export the video. The app doesn't allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to further edit a stop motion video.

Make sure you give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone's camera and photo library for it to function correctly.
