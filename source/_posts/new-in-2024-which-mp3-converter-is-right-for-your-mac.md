Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.
