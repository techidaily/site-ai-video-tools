 The updated version of Movie Rotator allows users to convert films and movies into portrait mode from landscape, or vice versa. It's perfect for moving MOV file formats onto your hand held devices so you can watch films there in comfort. Movie Rotator 2.0 is specifically for those that have upgraded their operating systems to Windows 7 or 8\. If you are still using XP or Vista you should stick to the old version.
