### 2\. Adobe Premiere Pro - for 8K video editing

**Price:** $20,99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Importing and editing 8K footage with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019 isn’t any different than editing videos captured in lower resolutions. However, this video editing software for Mac and PC computers **doesn’t let you choose the 8K resolution from its Export window**. That is why you must adjust a project’s resolution from the Sequence Settings window before you actually start manipulating the footage.

So if you change the Editing mode to Custom and you set the resolution of a sequence to 7680 x 4320, Adobe Premiere Pro will allow you to export your video in the 8K resolution.

Keep in mind that you must also change the codec to  from the Export Settings window in order to get the maximum video quality. Optionally, you can experiment with different export settings depending on the type of project you’re working on and the quality of the output file you would like to create.

Despite the fact that the process of creating 8K videos with Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical, this 8K video editing software is still one of the best options you can find on the market. Moreover, the video editing tools you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your 8K videos with this video editing app are going to enable you to produce professional-looking videos.

Besides, you can now play up to three streams of 8K ProRes raw videos captured with RED and other professional cameras. These improvements enable you to import, process and export 8K videos much faster than ever before, which is the reason why Final Cut Pro X is currently one of the best, if not the best 8K video editing software for Mac computers.

You should keep in mind that you are going to need at least 8 GB and preferably more of RAM and lots of storage space if you are planning on editing 8K footage with Final Cut Pro X on a constant basis. [Using proxies](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can make the process of editing 8K video files much faster, but you are still going to need a hard-drive where you can keep all of your high-resolution materials.

### Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

### Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

### Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites

#### 1\. Where can I download PC games for free?

There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store & Microsoft stores. You can play & download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com & miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.

#### 2\. What is the safest website to download free games?

Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.

#### 3\. Can we download PC games on Android?

There isn't a straightforward answer to this question. By 'download,' if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia & Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (& in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.

## Part 2: How to Install Android Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

Editing videos on a Chromebook can be beneficial for so many different reasons, but at the moment only a few Chromebooks allow you to use Android video editor apps. Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let's go through it step by step.

#### Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App

The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don't. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings.jpg)

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Beautifully captured cinematic footage with crystal clear results and melodious audio attracts viewers and leaves an everlasting impression. However, if there is a delay in the audio and video, you need to sync audio and video clips.

Only an advanced video-editing software like Final Cut Pro X can solve this problem and get everything lined up and cohesive. Its auto-sync feature allows you to adjust audio with video and present your footage realistically and creatively. Similarly, users can create Multicam clips and include multiple clips at any given angle with the FCPX.

Read this beginner’s guide to learn how to sync audio and video and create Multicam clips in the Final Cut Pro X.

> * [Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?](#part2)

> * [Part 4: Fast Ways to Sync Multicam in Final Cut Pro X](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

![sync-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sync-audio.png)

If you are experiencing an audio and video sync problem due to an over-taxing of your computer’s processor, follow these steps to relieve processor stress and solve your problem.

* Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”
* Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping
* Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X
* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks
* Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option
* Avoid opening multiple sequences simultaneously
* Render the video sequence to a single file.

## Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X is an advanced and user-friendly video editing application. Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.

To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.

![dorp-window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/dorp-window.png)

Users can also use custom settings for an advanced syncing process by adjusting different parameters according to their preferences. The following section explains the manual syncing process of audio and video clips in Final Cut Pro X.

This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma/period keys, while the left/right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.

Sync can be pretty easy with handy editing tools, like final cut pro, or Filmora, a much friendlier editor for beginners. Learn more about sync in the video below.

## Part 3: How to Match Audio and Video Manually in Final Cut Pro X?

After you have captured beautifully cinematic footage of a beach and recorded the audio separately, it’s time to add magic. If your results are crystal clear and the audio sounds melodious, you need to sync the audio and video clips and get everything lined up and cohesive.

Follow these simple steps to sync audio and video manually with Final Cut Pro X:

* First of all, import your audio and video clips and in the FCPX browser and select the ones to be synced;
* Select any two clips from imported files and right-click on them to open a dropdown menu. Choose Clip > Synchronize Clips to begin the syncing process. You can also use the shortcut Option + Command + G;

![step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/step2.jpg)

* Final Cut Pro X will analyze the clips and create a new clip by identifying the exact sync point. Once the analysis has been completed, give a name to your newly-synced clip and select the Use Audio for syncing. Keep organization in your mind since you may have to manage with multiple clips depending on your project size. Besides, you can remove your reference audio from the video track by disabling audio components on AV clips;
