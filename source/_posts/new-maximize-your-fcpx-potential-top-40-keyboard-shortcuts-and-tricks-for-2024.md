I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

## FAQ

* **What to do when the shortcuts in FCPX not working?**

Change your input source of keyboard set to US should fix the problem.

* **How to modify shortcuts in FCPX?**

There are two ways to open the modifying menu: choose Final Cut Pro > Commands > Customize, or press Option-Command-K. Then, change the shortcuts and save.

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

1. Is Audacity good for the new learner?

Because it is so easy to use, Audacity is a great software for beginners who want to record and edit voices and recordings like a pro because it is so easy to use. Before we learn how to use Audacity step by step, let's look at some of the things that make it useful.

1. How long can Audacity record for?

Since Audacity stores samples as 64-bit values (even on 32-bit devices), there is no 32-bit rule that says recordings can't be longer than 231 samples (which is for example, just over 13.5 hours at a 44,100 Hz sample rate).

1. How do I change things in Apowersoft?

Use magic and fantasy to make your edits. To cut or crop a video file, click the scissors or cropping icon, depending on what you want to do. To join videos, drag files into the timeline in the order you want. Add filters and video overlay to your movie to make it look better.

## Edit Like a Pro: The Ultimate Guide to GoPro HD Video Editing

# The Free and Easy Way to Edit GoPro HD Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

One of the best benefits of GoPro HD videos is that they are encoded in an MPEG4 formats. There are a lot of different options for editing these files but they cost money. Depending on your situation though, you may be able to edit your files with a program that is free and easy to use.

* [Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos](#consideration)
* [Choosing the Right Software Package for Your Go Pro project](#choosing)

## Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos

If you are thinking about using one of the free GoPro HD video editors, you should take the following points into consideration.

#### 1\. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format

This means you will need to find software that is will be able to import these kinds of files. Make sure you look up the specifications for all of the programs you consider to make sure the one you pick can handle the GoPro format.

#### 2\. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file

Most free programs make it really easy to do basic editing, but you are going to need to pay for a program if you want to do any heavy duty editing. Make sure you carefully read the features before you download it to make sure you have what you are need to complete your editing. Also, some programs are only free for personal use, so if you need a program for business purposes you are probably going to have to pay a fee.

#### 3\. Consider the output formats

You will need to check out the different output formats that are available with the free software. If you plan to share the video over social media, make sure that the editing software includes that as an option. If you would like to burn the video to a DVD, make sure that the program is capable of writing to a disc.

## Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project

Once you are through considering these different points, you can start looking at the different free and easy editing software available. Here are a few suggestions based on how much editing you want to do.

#### 1 _Just the Basics_

There are more options available if you only need to do basic editing, like cutting the length of the video, joining different parts together, or adding music. The following are three of the best programs to handle basic video editing of MP4 files.

* **Windows Movie Maker** is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.
* **VLC Media Player** is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.
* **Animoto** is great for joining together several different videos, although only the Lite account is free and has a number of restrictions.

#### 2 _A Robust Program_

If you want something robust and effective, the best option is Wondershare Filmora. It lets you do more than just basic editing, allowing you to work with a number of different video formats. Once you download it, you will find that it is very user-friendly from the onset. Best of all, you can share videos from the program, something that the basic editors won’t let you do without paying for that ability.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Magix Movie Edit Pro 2015 Plus** excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

## Conclusion

GoPro HD videos are an incredibly popular format, but it is a bit more of a challenge to find a free editing program that will work with these files. Many free or lite versions of packages let you do very basic editing, but they come with a lot of restrictions and want you to spend money to upgrade it. If you want something that’s easy to use and performs well, Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice.
