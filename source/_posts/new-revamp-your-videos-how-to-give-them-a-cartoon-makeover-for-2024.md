Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

If you need to cartoon your video, you can try Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The newly released Filmora professional video editing software can allow you to turn videos into cartoons with ease. The processing of converting videos into cartoon style is easy, just import the videos into Filmora, and then add the Cartoon effect under Stylize.

This process can be very slow, especially if the person you are outlining has long hair or wears a sweater that has a wrinkled sleeve. Once you are done with this step you can proceed to paint the figure using the Color Fill tool. It is important to be patient and go through this stage of the process slowly in order to avoid making mistakes.
