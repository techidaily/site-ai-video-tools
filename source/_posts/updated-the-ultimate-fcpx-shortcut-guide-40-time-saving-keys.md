I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

## FAQ

* **What to do when the shortcuts in FCPX not working?**

Change your input source of keyboard set to US should fix the problem.

* **How to modify shortcuts in FCPX?**

There are two ways to open the modifying menu: choose Final Cut Pro > Commands > Customize, or press Option-Command-K. Then, change the shortcuts and save.

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

## FAQ

* **What to do when the shortcuts in FCPX not working?**

Change your input source of keyboard set to US should fix the problem.

* **How to modify shortcuts in FCPX?**

There are two ways to open the modifying menu: choose Final Cut Pro > Commands > Customize, or press Option-Command-K. Then, change the shortcuts and save.

The raw footage you record with your Smartphone or digital camera is not going to be saved in WebM file format. However, certain screen and [webcam recorders](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture videos in this format, which means that you are going to need a video editing app in order to process the WebM videos.

Finding a [video editing app you can use for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and that supports this video file format can be a daunting task. That is why we combed through the Internet in search of the **best free WebM video editors** you can use online or on your desktop computer. Here’s what we’ve come up with.

* [Part 1: Best Online WebM Video Editors](#part1)

Editing videos on the Internet has its challenges, as most online video editors offer only a limited set of video editing tools. Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos.

In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.
