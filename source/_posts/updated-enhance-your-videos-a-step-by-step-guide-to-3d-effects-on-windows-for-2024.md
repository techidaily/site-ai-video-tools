## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.

![export video with 3d effects windows photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video-with-3d-effects-windows-photos-app.jpg)

Next, choose your preferred destination folder in the **Save As** box that opens up next, specify the name of the output file in the **File name** field, and click **Export** to export the modified clip in MP4 format.

**Note:** Videos that you export from the Photos app are by default saved in MP4 format.

As one of the [best basic video editing software for beginners](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the Microsoft Photos app allows you trim video, add text to video and much more. For details, check [how to edit videos with the Microsoft Photos app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

For macOS 10.12 or later

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Once this is done, preview the video, click **Export** from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the **Export** box to export the modified video in your preferred format.

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.

Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here's how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.

* [Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part4)
* [Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software](#part5)

## Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook

The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.

* Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.
* Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.
* Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.

## Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook

After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.

#### 1. Acessing the developer mode

The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-1.jpg)

#### 2. Installing Chroot

At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook's terminal a feature called 'Crosh'. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the 'shell' command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: 'sudo sh \~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce' and if you want to install extensions you will have to add 'xfce,extension' command at the end.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg)

Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: 'sudo enter-chroot startxfce4'. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.

#### 3. Optimizing your new OS

You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard's brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you've accessed Chrome OS's shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: 'sudo sh -e \~/Downloads/crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u' and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.

#### 4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook

If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the 'OS verification is off' message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.

## Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu

An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn't advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type 'chronos' and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: 'curl -L -O <http://goo.gl/9sgchs>; sudo bash 9sgchs' and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you've made your choice press Enter.

#### 2. Installing ChrUbuntu

Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing 'chronos' to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select /dev/sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.

Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the 'OS Verification is Off' notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-3.jpg)

#### 3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu

Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert 'chrome://imageburner' in your browser's address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.

This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.

## Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS

If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn't complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device's Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome://System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. [Hardware Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility) page will provide the information regarding the CPU's family, which can be crucial for the OS' performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn't allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.

#### 2. Enabling the Legacy Mode

Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ' OS verification is OFF' notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you've successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the 'Crosh' terminal and then type 'shell'. At the 'chronos/localhost/$ issue the following command: 'sudo crossystem dev\_boot\_legacy=1'. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.

#### 3. Installation process

If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you'll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you've completed this step issue the following command: 'curl -O <https://chrx.org/go> && sh go' and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the 'OS Verification is Off' notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.

#### Which Method is the Best?

Each of the options to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook we described has its advantages and disadvantages. It is our opinion that the Crouton method is the easiest and the fastest. Furthermore, this method enables you to switch between your primary and secondary OS without the need to reboot the device and the Downloads folder makes working in both environments much easier.

On the other hand, other methods require more knowledge about the Linux OS installation process and switching between OS' is not that simple. If you are looking for an easy way to dual-boot your Chromebook that best way to do it is to install Linux as a Chroot using Crouton.

## Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software: Lightworks

**Price:** $24.99/month, although free versions of the software are also available.

**What we like:** A powerful video and audio editor perfectly suited for the production of professional video content.

**What we don't like:** The software isn't easy to use and inexperienced editors will find it difficult to use at first.

Lightworks Resolve may not be as popular as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, but that doesn't mean that this video editing software isn't as capable as its more popular counterparts.

The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux OS, which makes it a perfect choice for Chromebook users that have a Linux OS installed on their devices. Lightworks features literally every editing tool imaginable and for that reason, it is a perfect choice for editing videos you would like to upload to Vimeo or YouTube or high-end professional projects. This editing software offers plenty of transitions and visual effects that will help its users to create seamless jumps between shots and visually impressive videos.

* Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.
* Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.

## Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook

After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.

#### 1. Acessing the developer mode

The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.

#### 2. Installing Chroot

At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook's terminal a feature called 'Crosh'. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the 'shell' command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: 'sudo sh \~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce' and if you want to install extensions you will have to add 'xfce,extension' command at the end.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg)

Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: 'sudo enter-chroot startxfce4'. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.

#### 3. Optimizing your new OS

You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard's brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you've accessed Chrome OS's shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: 'sudo sh -e \~/Downloads/crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u' and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.

#### 4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook

If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the 'OS verification is off' message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.

## Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu

An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn't advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type 'chronos' and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: 'curl -L -O <http://goo.gl/9sgchs>; sudo bash 9sgchs' and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you've made your choice press Enter.

#### 2. Installing ChrUbuntu

Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing 'chronos' to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select /dev/sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.

Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the 'OS Verification is Off' notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-3.jpg)

#### 3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu

Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert 'chrome://imageburner' in your browser's address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.

This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.

## Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS

If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn't complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device's Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome://System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. [Hardware Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility) page will provide the information regarding the CPU's family, which can be crucial for the OS' performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn't allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.

#### 2. Enabling the Legacy Mode

Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ' OS verification is OFF' notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you've successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the 'Crosh' terminal and then type 'shell'. At the 'chronos/localhost/$ issue the following command: 'sudo crossystem dev\_boot\_legacy=1'. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.

#### 3. Installation process

If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you'll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you've completed this step issue the following command: 'curl -O <https://chrx.org/go> && sh go' and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the 'OS Verification is Off' notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.

#### Which Method is the Best?

Each of the options to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook we described has its advantages and disadvantages. It is our opinion that the Crouton method is the easiest and the fastest. Furthermore, this method enables you to switch between your primary and secondary OS without the need to reboot the device and the Downloads folder makes working in both environments much easier.

On the other hand, other methods require more knowledge about the Linux OS installation process and switching between OS' is not that simple. If you are looking for an easy way to dual-boot your Chromebook that best way to do it is to install Linux as a Chroot using Crouton.

## Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software: Lightworks

**Price:** $24.99/month, although free versions of the software are also available.

**What we like:** A powerful video and audio editor perfectly suited for the production of professional video content.

**What we don't like:** The software isn't easy to use and inexperienced editors will find it difficult to use at first.

Lightworks Resolve may not be as popular as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, but that doesn't mean that this video editing software isn't as capable as its more popular counterparts.

The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux OS, which makes it a perfect choice for Chromebook users that have a Linux OS installed on their devices. Lightworks features literally every editing tool imaginable and for that reason, it is a perfect choice for editing videos you would like to upload to Vimeo or YouTube or high-end professional projects. This editing software offers plenty of transitions and visual effects that will help its users to create seamless jumps between shots and visually impressive videos.

Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.

Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here's how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.

## Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook

The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.

* Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.
* Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.

## Trim Your Videos for Free: 10 Best Online Tools

# 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers to Edit Videos Quickly

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

## Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?

There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.

It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.

If this article helped you, then feel free to share our 10 best free online video trimmers article on social media. Let your friends know which free online video trimmer you like the best.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.
