VLC Media Player supports MPEG and DivX streaming. ZIP files may also be played without extracting them one by one.

## 10\. Avidemux

[Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) is a **free video editor** for Windows, Mac, and Linux that doesn't aim to be a full-fledged timeline-based video editing software. Rather, it's made to make a few minor modifications and then splits out a new file.

You may import your source video and pick the start and finish frames to chop off segments. You may add filters to enhance the video by sharpening the picture or decreasing noise.

Some of the aesthetic options include color effects and borders, while others enhance the clip by sharpening the image or reducing noise. You may even add other clips to the end of your existing one, although this type of work would be better suited to a complete non-linear editor.

If you don't need to make any changes to the video, Avidemux may come in handy; as part of its exporting process, it allows you to do so.

**Pros**

* Decent aesthetic options for video editing
* Edit multiple videos at the same time
* Multiple stickers to add to your videos

**Cons**

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.
