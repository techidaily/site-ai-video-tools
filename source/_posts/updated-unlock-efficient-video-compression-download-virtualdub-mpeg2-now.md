VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats.

In addition, iPhones and Android phones are also equipped with microphones that enable you to record sound alongside the video.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best MP4 to [MP3 apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for iOS and Android devices.

## Best Free MP4 to MP3 Apps for Android Devices

Recording videos in high resolution is no longer a far-fetched dream because there are quite a few models on the market capable of producing crispy-sharp images. [Converting a video file into an audio file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) doesn’t require too much effort because there are quite a few third-party apps that let you accomplish this task in just a few moments. Here are some of the **best MP4 to MP3 apps** for Android devices.

#### 1. Video to MP3 Converter

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-converter.jpg)

Extracting audio from video is just one out of many functionalities this app offers. Video to MP3 Converter features both Simple and Advanced MP3 conversion modes so that you can have complete control over the audio extraction process. The app provides support for MP4, WMW or AVI video file formats among numerous others, while its Video Cutter tool enables you to remove all segments of a video clip you don’t want others to see. Video to MP3 converter also features the audio cutting tool that lets you create a new ringtone for your phone effortlessly. You can also control the bitrate of the audio files you’re making because the app lets you generate files with bitrates that vary from just 48 kb/s to 320 kb/s.

#### 2. MP4 to MP3 - Convert Video to Audio

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp4-to-mp3-convert-video-to-audio-cut-ringtones.jpg)

Converting MP4, AVI or MKV video files into MP3s is a fun and easy process. In addition, this app lets you add metadata to each new MP3 file you create which makes organizing huge music libraries painless. What’s more, this MP4 to MP3 converter allows you to cut both audio and video files which makes it a perfect tool for making unique ringtones. The batch conversion feature enables you to convert multiple MP4 files into MP3s at the same time. Even though the MP4 to MP3 app is free, getting rid of ads currently isn’t possible.

#### 3. Video to MP3 Converter

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-converter-mp3-tagger.jpg)

Video to MP3 Converter is compatible with all devices running on Android 4.0 or later versions of the OS. You can use it to convert all video files on your phone to audio files, in just a few steps. Simply pick a video you’d like to convert, choose MP3 output formats, add the metadata like the name of the artist or the song’s title, specify the preferred bitrate and tap on the Convert button. After the conversion, you can merge multiple MP3s into a single audio file, but unfortunately, you won’t be able to convert several video files simultaneously.

#### 4. MP3 Video Converter

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-video-converter.jpg)

This is a simple and powerful file conversion tool that lets you convert video files saved in formats like MP4, 3GP or FlV to MP3 audio files. Selecting a bitrate of the output file or adding the title of a song and an album won’t take too much of your time. However, the MP3 Video Converter doesn’t offer audio or video editing tools, so you can’t cut or merge several audio files together. What’s more, your device needs ARMv7 in order to run this app, which means that you won’t be able to use it on older models of Android phones.

#### 5. Video to MP3 Converter – MP3 Cutter and Merger

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-converter-mp3-cutter-merger.jpg)

## Best MP4 to MP3 Apps for iPhones and iPad

Selecting an MP4 to MP3 app for iPhone can be a bit complicated because there are so many apps to choose from. We’ve narrowed down the selection to just five apps in order to make the selection process easier for you, so let's take a look at some of the best MP4 to MP3 apps you can find at the App Store.

#### 1. Video to MP3 Music Player

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-music-player.jpg)

Converting an MP4 file from your video library into a high-quality MP3 audio file with this app is a simple 3-step process. You just have to tap on the + button, select a file you want to convert and hit the Convert button. You can also specify the time intervals at which you would like the file conversions to take place and create MP3 files without any quality loss. The app supports all frequently used video file formats, so you can convert videos that are saved in a broad range of formats. As its name indicates, Video to MP3 Music Player lets you play music, and it also enables you to share MP3 files to WhatsApp, Messenger, and other apps.

#### 2. The Audio Converter

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-audio-converter.jpg)

The Audio Converter app lets you convert both video and audio files to a broad range of audio file formats. You can convert MP4, m4v, amr, MPEG files formats among numerous others to MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, and other audio file formats. All conversions take place on a cloud server, which means that you can’t use The Audio Converter while your iPhone is offline. Keep in mind that the free version of the app offers only limited functionalities and you must purchase either Premium Pass or Lifetime Pass if you want to use it to convert MP4 to MP3 on a constant basis.

#### 3. Video to MP3 – Convert Audio

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-convert-audio.jpg)

iPhone owners in need of an app that can convert MP4 to MP3 in fifteen seconds should consider installing this app on their devices. You can convert all videos stored on your phone’s camera roll or you can import a video from Dropbox, One Drive, iCloud and other online file hosting platforms. Video to MP3 – Convert Audio lets you set the starting and ending points of the new audio file, which means that you can convert only a portion of an MP4 video file to MP3\. All videos you convert to MP3 can be shared on social media or messaging apps and you can transfer all converted files to a computer using the iTunes File Sharing feature.

#### 4. MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter  for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-converter-audio-extractor.jpg)

Converting a video saved on your phone’s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You won’t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the app’s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you won’t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 you’re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor has to offer.

#### 5. Media Converter – Video to MP3

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-converter-video-to-mp3.jpg)

Besides extracting audio from video, you can use the app’s built-in media player to watch videos or listen to music. Media Converter – Video to MP3 supports a broad range of input file formats and it lets you convert them to MP3, M4A, WAV, and other audio file formats. This app lacks more advanced MP4 to MP3 file conversion options since you can’t select the preferred bitrate of the output files or add tags to them. The app contains ads, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove them. Even the Pro version of the Media Converter – Video to MP3 doesn’t offer the file-sharing options.

The app contains ads, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove them. Even the Pro version of the Media Converter – Video to MP3 doesn’t offer the file-sharing options.

**Conclusion**

Each of the apps we featured in the article makes creating impressive audio libraries from the videos you record with your iPhone or Android phone look easy. However, since the number of file conversion tools these apps offer can vary, choosing an MP4 to MP3 app is a bit more complicated.

There is no doubt that Smartphone cameras can capture videos in breathtaking quality, but using a phone as a camera still has its challenges. The footage recorded with a Smartphone can often be shaky, especially if you’re shooting handheld or it can just contain parts that you don’t want to share with your followers on social media. In 2024, you can edit all videos immediately after you capture them, but in order to do that, you first need to discover a **vlog editor app**  that you really like using. That’s why we are going to take you through some of the best apps you can use to quickly edit your vlogs before you publish them on your iPhone or Android phones.

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

**●** Optimizing the video for the mobile phone users: Several times your video may run smoothly on your system but may have issues while playing on a mobile phone. So, keep your texts and important content within the specified size so that even if the video is cropped it does not look awkward.

**●** Go for prompt action: It is always better to get the CTA opportunities whenever available. When something specific is required from a video like increasing traffic, adding more clients, and similar others, let the video prompt to do that and avoid adding too much text.

**●** Audio is not very critical: Though audio can be added to the cover video, it does not have much relevance to the content you wish to showcase to the viewer. By default, the videos on Facebook are muted and also around 85% of the videos are watched without the sound.

**●** Keep the focus on one visual: A Facebook page is already too crowded and thus avoids loading the cover video with too much content. Focus on a single visual which can be text, image, CTA, or other depending on your purpose.

**●** Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.

**●** Keeping the right size: Keeping the recommended **Facebook cover page video size** is important to make the video appear without any distortion, borders, or cropping.
