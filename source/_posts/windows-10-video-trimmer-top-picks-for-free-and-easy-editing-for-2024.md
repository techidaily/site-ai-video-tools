Your homemade videos can quickly become stunning VR experiences if you chose to purchase this remarkably versatile video converter. Beside offering impressive video and audio file conversion options the Aiseesoft Video Converter Ultimate also enables you to add external audio tracks to videos, enhance the colors of the videos you’re converting or stabilize shaky footage.

The long list of supported file formats guarantees that you can convert your video and audio files to virtually any file format including Full HD or 4K.

To convert a normal video to VR you only have to select the files you’d like to convert, pick one of the available 3D modes and click on the Convert button.

The software lets you adjust the output resolution or the aspect ratio of the converted videos. The number of the supported VR headsets is a bit limited, but you can still create videos for VR headset models such as Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or VR One.

## How to Pick the Best VR Video Converters

Taking into consideration the number of **supported VR file formats**, the overall capacity of a software or the level of control over the conversion process offered by a software will help you choose the right VR video converter.

The **video editing options** or the **download features** can also be a part of the reason why you should choose one VR video converter over the other.

The **prices** for the software products that allow you to convert home videos to VR can vary and they often depend on the pricing plan you choose. However, checking if the software provides support for the VR headset you have is the most important step you need to take while deciding which VR video converter, you’re going to buy since you won’t be able to enjoy your videos in VR if the headset isn’t supported by the software.

## Conclusion

Over the last couple of years, VR headsets and media players have become quite popular, because they are offering nearly unlimited entertainment possibilities. Video converters can help you keep your supply of VR videos constantly updated, as they offer a quick way to convert a regular video file format to a VR video.
