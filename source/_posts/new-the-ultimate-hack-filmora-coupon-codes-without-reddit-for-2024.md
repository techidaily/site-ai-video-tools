![aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-1.jpg)

In this guide, we'll talk about everything you need to know about the **photo ratio calculator**.

05 [The Resolution Calculator (image Ration Calculator)](#Part 5)

06 [A Practical Explanation about Aspect Ratios in Filmora](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

**W1 \* A% = W2**

You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:

**Proportions**

**●** 4:3,

**●** 3:2,

**●** 16:9,

**●** 16:10,

**●** 1:1, square, in some social networks,

**●** 85:1,

**Pixels**

**●** 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;

**●** 1920:1080, HD TV, iPhone 6 plus; and

**●** 800:600, traditional television & computer monitor standard.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

**W1 \* A% = W2**

You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:

**Proportions**

**●** 4:3,

**●** 3:2,

**●** 16:9,

**●** 16:10,

**●** 1:1, square, in some social networks,

**●** 85:1,

**Pixels**

**●** 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;

**●** 1920:1080, HD TV, iPhone 6 plus; and

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

The article will throw more light on these tools that can **change ratio of video**.

#### In this article

01 [What is Aspect Ratio and Why Does It Matter?](#Part 1)

02 [Difference Between Aspect Ratio and Resolution](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is Aspect Ratio and Why Does It Matter?

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and the height of the video and it defines how your video will appear on the screen. The right aspect ratio is important to offer a pleasing viewing experience. With multiple social media sites supporting different aspect ratios, the need for changing them accordingly arises quite often.

The marketing, business, and all other activities have taken an online route and with this, the video content on several social media sites for promotion has also increased. So, if you upload a video with a certain aspect ratio on a different platform, they will look weird with cropped portions, black borders, and other issues that will lead to a negative viewing experience and impact.

Though there is no fixed or standard aspect ratio that can be considered as the best as different values are suitable for different platforms and sites. Some of the commonly used aspect ratios are as below.

**●** 16:9- This is one of the most widely used aspect ratios and appears in the form of a wide rectangle. The majority of the video players as well as capturing devices use this aspect ratio as their default settings. The best resolution that can be used with this aspect ratio is 3840 X 2160 pixels.

**●** 1:1- Originally this aspect ratio was used for square TV sets but now it is majorly used for the videos on Instagram and Facebook. A lot of cameras also support this setting.

**●** 9:16- The setting for this aspect ratio has become popular after the increased use of smartphones. Used for the tall videos, the setting can be seen in the videos posted as an Instagram story, Snapchat, and Facebook.

**●** 21:9 – This setting of the aspect ratio is used for cinematic widescreen or videos with the anamorphic format. The use of this aspect ratio is very particular and videos supporting this setting generally can be seen in theme parks, special theatres, and museums.

Regarding social media sites, below listed are the popularly used aspect ratio.

**●** Square (1:1) – Used for Facebook and Instagram feed videos.

**●** Vertical (9:16) – Best for Instagram story videos and snaps

**●** Horizontal (16:9) – Used for (9:16 YouTube videos

**●** Landscape (5:4) – Apt for landscape videos on Facebook and Twitter.

**●** Portrait (4:5) – Used for the portrait videos to be posted on Twitter and Facebook.

**●** For the Facebook cover video, 21:9 is the recommended aspect ratio.

## Part 2 Difference Between Aspect Ratio and Resolution

Aspect ratio and resolution are interrelated and go hand-in-hand. For a certain aspect ratio, there is several counterparts’ resolution that can be used. While the aspect ratio defines the width and the height relationship, the resolution is the number of pixels on the screen.

To obtain the resolution of a video, you will multiply the height by the width while for the aspect ratio, width is divided by the height. When the height is multiplied by its width times, the results you get represent the square pixels of your screen and this number dented the quality of the video. The higher the pixels, the higher will be the video quality.
