## Part 2: How to Add Plugins to Final Cut Pro X

The first step for installing any plugin is to get out of Final Cut Pro X if you have it open. You can refer to the steps below to install various kinds of Final Cut Pro X plugins.

#### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Go to your favorite site of plugins and search for tools. Here, we are referring to download the transition tools. Click the **Add to Cart** tab as shown in the image below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins download transition tools](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-download-transition-tools.jpg)

You will get its download in the form of a zip folder, which you have to unzip for sure.

Here, we have downloaded two transitions contained within one folder.

#### Step 2: Copy and Paste the Plugin

Now, you need to copy the plugin by right-clicking the entire folder, as shown below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins copy plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-copy-plugin.jpg)

Afterward, find the **Final Cut Pro X** in **Applications** folder from the **Finder** tab. Right-click the Final Cut Pro X and hit the **Show Package Content** option.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins show package contents](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-show-package-contents.jpg)

Then go to **Contents** \> **Plugins** \> **Media Providers** \> **Motion Effects.fxp** \> **Contents** \> **Resources** \> **Templates** \> **Transitions**.

Paste the item in the **Transition** folder as shown below.

Finally, there is one last step you need to do with the original files of the transition plugin.

Hit the first transition from the folder that you have just pasted. And, rename the white file that is the actual transition plugin with extension **.motr**. You are required to do the same thing with other transitions' folders.
