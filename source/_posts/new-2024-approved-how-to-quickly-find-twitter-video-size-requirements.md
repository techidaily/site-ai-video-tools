## How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

#### 1\. Installation

You can find [Avidemux for download here](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/), it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).

One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.

![Installation2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png)

Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.

## How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

#### 1\. Installation

You can find [Avidemux for download here](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/), it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).

One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.

![Installation2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png)

Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.

# Color Correction in Final Cut Pro

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

The steps below can help all beginners to develop easy video edited projects using Final Cut Pro, but if some of you find this platform a little difficult then it is good to start practicing as a beginner on [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”. ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![ Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

![correction On and Off options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-10.png)

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.
