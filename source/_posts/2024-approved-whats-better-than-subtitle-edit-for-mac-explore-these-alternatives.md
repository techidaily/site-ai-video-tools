Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.

## Part 1 What is the Aspect Ratio and Its Importance?

An aspect ratio in the simplest terms is defined as the relationship of the image width with its height. Denoted by x: y, where x is the width and h, is the height, an aspect ratio defines the shape of an image and can be different for different platforms and sites. Thus, one image with a certain aspect ratio might not fit perfectly on another site or a platform that supports a different aspect ratio. For instance, an image created for Facebook might not appear to be right in size when posted on Instagram. Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.

It is important to have the right aspect ratio as a set or recommended by the site or the platform so that they look appealing and interesting. To change ratio of image, there are several tools available.

## Conclusion

Purchasing video editing software is a long-term investment that will enable you to increase the quality of the videos you’re creating over time. This doesn’t mean that the videos you’re producing are going to become better overnight since most video editing apps only offer possibilities that can’t be properly utilized without proper video editing skills.

Well, If you haven't decided which one to go for so far, I would strongly recommend **Filmora** to you. It's **free** to try, you can download it with the buttons below, and click through to see if it matches your needs.
