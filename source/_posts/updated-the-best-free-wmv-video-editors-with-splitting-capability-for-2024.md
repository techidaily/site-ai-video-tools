## AVS Video Editor Review and Rating: Is It Worth the Hype ?

The AVS Video Editor edits videos and can make edits like cutting, trimming, splitting, and merging them. Both novices and professional filmmakers can use it because of its basic and advanced editing features. This recorder is compatible with DV/HDV, webcams, and VHS cameras. In addition, it allows you to capture the screen of your PC, take screenshots, and highlight mouse and keyboard movements with drawing tools. Create an emotional and persuasive effect by removing black bars with the Crop Scale and changing the aspect ratio.

![avs-video-editor-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avs-video-editor-poster.png)

 In addition to the above features, AVS Video Editor has a wide variety of patterns, stickers, emoji, arrows, and many others: \*150+ supported formats \*300+ visual effects and transitions \*Colour balance fine-tuning \*Video stabilization of shaky recordings \*Chromakey \*Playback Control (slow-mo and fast mo) \*A wide variety of text styles, animated captions, speech bubbles, and credits \*A rich collection of patterns. Publish your video in social media sites, burn a DVD/Blu-ray disc, or save your video in the format of your choice on your computer.

In this article, we will review the AVS editor briefly

## AVS Pros

* If you want to change the pace of your videos while maintaining their quality, you can use the video speed control.

### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage.

### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage. The camera can also capture media directly from the clipboard and even the desktop screen can be captured.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

You can add a variety of effects to your videos using AVS Video Editor, which makes it stand out from other video editing software. There are thousands of preset transitions and visual filters available for use within the program once you've opened a clip. Audio and brightness adjustments can also be made.

Other video editing software does not offer the same features as this one. AVS Video Editor, for example, allows you to add watermarks and overlays to videos without any lag time or loss in quality, which would be impossible with other programs.

The animated logos and text in the video are another great feature. Adding an intro or outro to the end of your video will give it that professional touch before you publish it on YouTube.

Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

## How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder
