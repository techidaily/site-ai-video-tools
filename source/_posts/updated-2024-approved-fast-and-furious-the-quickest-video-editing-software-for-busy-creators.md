#### 10\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

Our final offering is a slightly different take on the video cutter. This is an online offering that requires no downloads or installation, you simply go to the website, upload your video or select a video on the web, cut the video and save the output. It is very simple, although there is the obvious issue with larger files of upload and download time, but for many applications is perhaps the ideal solution.

## Top Five Hand Drawing Whiteboard Animation Makers in 2021

The so-called doodle videos are entertaining to watch because the viewer can see a hand drawing shapes or writing in front of their eyes. Creating this type of animated videos no longer requires years of training and hours of hard work, since there are countless options that enable marketers to produce whiteboard animations in just a few minutes. Here are some of the best whiteboard [animation makers online](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can find on the market in 2020.

#### 1. [Moovly](https://www.moovly.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24.92 per month billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

Moovly is much more than an online destination where you can create whiteboard animations effortlessly as it grants you access to more than a million royalty free images, videos, and sounds. The platform’s video editor lets you choose the gender of the hand that is drawing the animation or its skin color. In addition to simulating the hand drawing process of virtually any object you can think of, the Moovly’s editor also enables you to adjust the size of the elements you add to your story or incorporate handwritten text into the animation video you’re producing. The free version of the platform watermarks all videos you export and lacks any of the advanced features that are available if you opt for one of the education or subscription plans. Even so, Moovly is still one of the best web-based whiteboard animation makers you can find on the Internet because it lets you create new videos in just a few quick steps.

In addition, you can import assets you’ve created and VideoScribe will animate them for you. The voiceover feature is particularly useful if you are looking to add narration to your explainer and educational videos or product reviews. VideoScribe can only be used offline if you purchase its Pro version and you won’t be able to export HD video files if you opt to create your whiteboard animations with the free version of this software. This whiteboard animation maker is an excellent option for businesses that want to improve their social media presence through the production of animated whiteboard explainer videos or educational institutions that are looking for a way to keep their students engaged.

What’s more, the software has a rich library of transitions you can use to avoid hard cuts between the shots or to change scenes in your whiteboard animations smoothly. Besides whiteboard animations, you can use Explaindio to animate typography, create intros and outros for YouTube videos and to make logo strings. Cloud storage is also available so that you can access your creations while you’re on the go, which is one of the reasons why more than 35.000 YouTubers, marketers, and animators are already using Explaindio.

#### 4. [Doodly](https://www.doodly.com/)

The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles.

#### 4. [Doodly](https://www.doodly.com/)

**Price:** Pricing plans start at $39 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Hiring professional animators to create your whiteboard animations for you is both expensive and time-consuming. Doodly solves both of these issues by enabling you to simply drag and drop animated elements to the timeline and produce visually attractive hand-drawn animations at a reasonable price. The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles. The best part is that you can export all animations you create with Doodly in Full HD resolution.

#### 5. [Vyond](https://www.vyond.com/)

**Price:** 14-day free trial available, subscription plans start at $299 per year for a single user

**Compatibility:** web-based

Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.

#### **Conclusion**
