![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The videos you record with your phone often don’t last very long, which makes it a bit difficult to tell the entire story of the scene you captured. Fortunately, there are more than a few simple ways to combine and merge multiple clips, that don’t involve using professional video editing apps. So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.

![add-fire-effect-to-the-hand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/add-fire-effect-to-the-hand.jpg)

## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.

#### 1. [Merge Video](https://mergevideo.online/)

This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor)

![kapwing_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/kapwing_1.jpg)

The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.

#### 5. [Cellsea](http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor)

Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.

#### 6. [FlexClip](https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html)

## **Extensive Reading: Why Ken Burns Effect is Named after Ken Burns?**

**What is the Ken Burns Effect?**

The Ken Burns Effect is a feature in Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect by using your predefined start and end positions. Basically, it is a crop effect with one crop at the start of the clip while the other at the end. Ken Burns Effect can be further customized by adjusting the smoothness of the animation. While creating a Ken Burns Effect, the motion applied to the video clips gets automatically smoothed to accelerate and decelerate the movement slowly at the start and the end of the animation.

**Why the Effect is named after Ken Burns?**

Now, as you have learned the purpose of the Ken Burns Effect, you must be curious about its name. It is named after American documentarian Ken Burns, who is known for his instantly recognizable and highly influential visual aesthetic. Surprisingly, Ken Burns did not invent this Ken Burns Effect; rather, it has existed for decades. You might be wondering why the technique was then named after Ken Burns. This was due to the persistent and adroit use of this technique that it is now known as the Ken Burns Effect.

![ken-burns](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/ken-burns.png)

**What are the Applications of Ken Burns Effect?**

Primarily, the Ken Burns Effect is used due to the unavailability of a film or video. The technique gives action to still photographs to glorify the subjects of interest like couples in wedding photography. It gets better and better as you apply simulated parallax with Ken Burns Effect to make your 2D images appear as 3D plus advanced zooming visuals. You can also use the Ken Burns effect to make a video of your graduation ceremony pictures or memorable moments of reunion. Ken Burns Effect is also used in documentaries by professional filmmakers and editors.

**Conclusion**

Adding animated effects to your pictures and videos makes them look gorgeous. This is crazy, isn’t it, when you impress your peers with your editing skills. So, what’s the bottom line of this whole discussion? Try adding the Ken Burns Effect with Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect on your pictures and clips get the output in your desired format.

## Part 2: How to add the Ken Burns Effect to Multiple Camera Movements?

2. Duplicate the clip by click and drag option or copy and paste option;
3. Press the Swap button in the Ken Burns settings to reverse the start and end positions;
4. Verify if multiple camera movements have been added.

## **Extensive Reading: Why Ken Burns Effect is Named after Ken Burns?**

**What is the Ken Burns Effect?**

The Ken Burns Effect is a feature in Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect by using your predefined start and end positions. Basically, it is a crop effect with one crop at the start of the clip while the other at the end. Ken Burns Effect can be further customized by adjusting the smoothness of the animation. While creating a Ken Burns Effect, the motion applied to the video clips gets automatically smoothed to accelerate and decelerate the movement slowly at the start and the end of the animation.

**Why the Effect is named after Ken Burns?**

Now, as you have learned the purpose of the Ken Burns Effect, you must be curious about its name. It is named after American documentarian Ken Burns, who is known for his instantly recognizable and highly influential visual aesthetic. Surprisingly, Ken Burns did not invent this Ken Burns Effect; rather, it has existed for decades. You might be wondering why the technique was then named after Ken Burns. This was due to the persistent and adroit use of this technique that it is now known as the Ken Burns Effect.

![ken-burns](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/ken-burns.png)

**What are the Applications of Ken Burns Effect?**

Primarily, the Ken Burns Effect is used due to the unavailability of a film or video. The technique gives action to still photographs to glorify the subjects of interest like couples in wedding photography. It gets better and better as you apply simulated parallax with Ken Burns Effect to make your 2D images appear as 3D plus advanced zooming visuals. You can also use the Ken Burns effect to make a video of your graduation ceremony pictures or memorable moments of reunion. Ken Burns Effect is also used in documentaries by professional filmmakers and editors.

**Conclusion**

Adding animated effects to your pictures and videos makes them look gorgeous. This is crazy, isn’t it, when you impress your peers with your editing skills. So, what’s the bottom line of this whole discussion? Try adding the Ken Burns Effect with Final Cut Pro to create a pan and zoom effect on your pictures and clips get the output in your desired format.
