Video Cutter Online is a video editing platform that offers basic video editing tools that enable you to cut, trim, crop, or rotate videos quickly. You can either **drag and drop a video file from a folder on your computer or you can add a file to Video Cutter Online from an online source.** Once you’ve chosen the file you want to rotate you simply have **to click on the Rotate icon** first and then choose to rotate right or left to change the orientation of the video.

After you’ve rotated the video, you can **select the output quality** before clicking on the **Save button**. The platform lets you save your videos to your computer or your **Dropbox and Google Drive** accounts.

**Conclusion**

Each of the video editing platforms we featured in this article lets you rotate videos in just a few simple steps, but before you can start changing the orientation of a video you must make sure that the file you want to upload meets all of the platform’s specifications. Which online destination do you like to use the most to rotate your videos? In case you are looking for a video editing app for Windows and Mac which provides plentiful resources and effects, try Wondershare Filmora video editor.
