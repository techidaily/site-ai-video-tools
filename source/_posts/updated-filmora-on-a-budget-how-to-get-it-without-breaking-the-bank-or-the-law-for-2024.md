[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great tool for video creators. This dedicated software offers its users numerous different features that are aimed at making your video content better. It is widely loved by users for its prestigious and easy-to-use features.

However, much to many people’s dismay, Filmora is not free. But would you like to acquire the **Filmora free** version on your device? Would you like to download the Wondershare Filmora video editor for free and edit videos or photos without paying $49.99 annually? If so, here are some solutions to getting Filmora video editors completely free without violating the law.

* [Part 1: Getting Filmora Full Version for Free via Taking Mission](#part1)
* [Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)](#part2)

## Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos

Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project. Then you will see a pop-up window as shown below:

![ Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-filmora-for-free-take-mission.jpg)

Wondershare Filmora provides a 7-day license for users without Filmora subscription, and a perpetual effects pack for users already subscribed to it. Click the Take the Mission button to continue, and you will see the progress under the right corner.

![ complete Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/complete-mission-to-get-filmora-for-free.jpg)

Now, it’s time to import, edit and export video footage with Filmora. There are several ways to import media to Filmora, and the direct way is drag and drop the photo and video into the Project media library, and then place them in order in the timeline.

![ import  import your media files to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

* You can follow the software layout to add audio, titles, transitions, effects, elements accordingly. If you wish to [add sound to your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), go to "Audio" tab, find the proper music track or sound effect for your footage, and then drag it to the soundtrack in the timeline.

![ add sound effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

* The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.
* In the next step, add overlays or [transitions in your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.

![ add transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

* Finally, click on the "Export" button and select the "Local" tab. Choose a name and file format for your video and tap "Export."

![save your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Once you are done with compiling one video, follow the same steps as mentioned above twice more so that you have exported three videos in total from Filmora. You can see your progress in the gift box in the right corner. Click Claim Your Rewards and you will a pop-up window as shown below.

![ claim your Filmora license](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/claim-free-filmora-license.jpg)

Now, click the **Claim your Free 7-day License** button, by doing so, you will get the Filmora License, i.e., your Filmora version is now full and free.

Once you have acquired the **Filmora free** license, you can go back and import the previous projects, edit again and remove the watermark.

Launch Filmora again, and then find the project you just made in the Start window and open it. Or you can click New Project to enter the main interface, click File - Open Recent, find the project. Log in with your Wondershare ID and click on the "Export" button. Your video will now be exported without a watermark.
