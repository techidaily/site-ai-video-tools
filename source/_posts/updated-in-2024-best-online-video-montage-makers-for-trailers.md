**Step 1: Download and Install Filmora**

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-1.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-2.jpg)

**Step 2: Import the Video You Want to Rotate**

The next is to bring the video file to Filmora’s library before proceeding. To do that, click on the “Movie Clip” icon in the center of the interface to select the clip from your computer’s hard drive.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg)

Double-click or select the video and click the “Open” button to import files. The importing process may take several seconds or a few minutes, depending on the video size.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg)

If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg)

The new name will appear at the top of Filmora’s interface.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-18.jpg)

Lastly, click the “Export” button to save the file on your computer.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

## How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.

### Method 1: Locating the Preferences

You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.

The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.

### Method 2: Deleting Render Files

This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area.

You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.

### Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder

This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.

## Final Word

Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.

You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.

### Method 2: Deleting Render Files

Do remember to save your important files before you do this. [Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.

You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.

### Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder

This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.

## Final Word

Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.
