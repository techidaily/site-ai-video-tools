Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

> * [Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?](#part1)
> * [Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?](#part2)
> * [Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos?](#part3)
> * [Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in easy ways?](#part4)

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?

The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.

**Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate**

To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.

![frame-rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/frame-rate.png)

**Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction**

After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function
2. Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT

![color-grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color-grading.png)

1. Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope
2. Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors
3. Adjust your color grade according to your requirements
4. Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones
5. You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.

**Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing**

Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.

* Select your video and click on the Retiming button
* Tap on the Slow section

![slow-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png)

* You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip
* The smaller number will slow down your footage
* To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option
* Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want
* After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.

**Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos**

Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:

1. Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline
2. Place the film grain on top of your clip
3. Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen
4. Click on the Overlay and adjust the opacity of the film grain overlay as required.

 ![filmgrain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmgrain.png)

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

Here’s how you can add a cinematic look to your footage with Filmora.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmora.png)

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

> * [Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in easy ways?](#part4)

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?

**Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate**

To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.

## The Ultimate List: Best Mac Speech-to-Text Apps That Don't Require a Download [Free and Easy to Use]

Do you struggle to meet deadlines for your text assignments? If you do, then you are in luck. Speech recognition technology is the best way to beat this challenge. Whether you are a student or a corporate professional, several speech-to-text apps can be used to guarantee that you meet your deadlines. For example, Mac owners can use dragon for Mac to complete typing assignments in half the time.

Below are the best speech-to-text apps on Mac you might have missed since the beginning of 2022\. Some of the apps in the list are in-built into your device, while others may require you to download additional software. Regardless, all of those listed below are free to use on your Mac device. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: Top 1 Built-in Mac Dictation Feature

![top 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-1.jpg)

Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device's microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.

The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.

Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.

Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:

1. Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select **System Preferences** from the resulting menu.
2. Click on the **Keyboard** option from the system preferences screen.
3. Once there, click on the **Dictation** option located at the top of the menu.
4. Select **On** to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the **Use Enhanced Dictation** box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.
5. Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.

Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.

## Part2: Top 2 Microsoft Word \[Free & No Download\]

![top 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-2.jpg)

Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.

* An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.
* An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.
* Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.
* An active internet connection.

Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.
2. Click on the **Dictate** button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.
3. Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.
4. Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.

## Part3: Top 3 Google docs

![top 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-3.jpg)

Google Docs is arguably the market's most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.

Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:

1. Launch the **Chrome** browser on your macOS and select **Docs** from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.
2. Open a new document and click on the **Tools** tab from the top menu.
3. Select **Voice Typing** from the menu to access speech-to-text on Google Docs.
4. Tap the microphone to start transcribing, and tap it again to finish.

Google Docs speech-to-text is available in 71 languages. In addition, it supports simple commands such as 'create a bulleted list,' which are unavailable on other speech-to-text apps. As such, it is one of the market's most popular voice typing apps.

## Part4: Top 4 [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![top 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

However, with Filmora's speech-to-text function, you can add subtitles to your video with a single click. In addition, it automatically recognizes audio in your videos and transcribes it to text with incredible accuracy. The plugin uses state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure the video industry's most accurate speech technology.

As such, it is a favorite for vloggers, teachers, and film editors, who all have to deliver their content with great efficiency.

Please note that you must have Filmora installed on your Mac device to access the Speech to Text plugin. In addition, check if your Filmora version is compatible with the plugin before downloading. Once you confirm that you meet all the requirements, here is how to use the service:

## Part5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac

![top 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg)

Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.

Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance's Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.

Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018\. In addition, Microsoft's acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.

## Part6: FAQs

### Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech-to-text?

Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech-to-text functionality. For example, Siri will ask you to repeat a sentence several times as one of the setup steps.

### Which is the best external device for the speech-to-text service?

Most users report better speech-to-text accuracy when using headsets compared to using an external microphone. This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.

### Can speech-to-text apps automatically translate a transcribed text?

Yes, they can. Apps such as Google's Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.

### How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?

A 2017 Stanford study states that speech to text is about[three times faster than typing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3161187). In addition, it found that speech-to-text apps can transcribe over 150 words per minute, while professional transcriptionists range between 50 to 80 words per minute.

Adding subtitles to your videos can be incredibly time-consuming if you do not have the right tools. However, with Filmora's speech-to-text function, you can add subtitles to your video with a single click.

Furthermore, you can import external files to your video's timeline and edit them as you please. For example, you can import a video from your thumb drive and use the Filmora speech-to-text plugin to transcribe to text. Currently, the plugin can transcribe the text in 26 languages. As such, it is a favorite for vloggers, teachers, and film editors, who all have to deliver their content with great efficiency.

Please note that you must have Filmora installed on your Mac device to access the Speech to Text plugin. In addition, check if your Filmora version is compatible with the plugin before downloading. Once you confirm that you meet all the requirements, here is how to use the service:

## Part5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac

![top 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg)

Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.

Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance's Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.

Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018\. In addition, Microsoft's acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.

## Part6: FAQs

### Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech-to-text?

Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech-to-text functionality. For example, Siri will ask you to repeat a sentence several times as one of the setup steps.

### Which is the best external device for the speech-to-text service?

Most users report better speech-to-text accuracy when using headsets compared to using an external microphone. This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.

### Can speech-to-text apps automatically translate a transcribed text?

Yes, they can. Apps such as Google's Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny.
