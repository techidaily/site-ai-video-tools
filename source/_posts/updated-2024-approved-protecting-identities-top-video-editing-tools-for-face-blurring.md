#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well. Available for both **MacOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Premiere Pro?**

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.

A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the **horizontal video size** is less than its vertical size.

**●**   **Why Vertical Video is Dominating**

It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.

With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.

**●**   **Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos**

There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically

designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.

## Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed

Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s**creen aspect ratio calculator**, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.

## Part 3 What's the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?

Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.

**●** **Learn about the Aspect Ratios**

A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also **TV aspect ratio calculator** tools that can be used for the task.

![Learn About Aspect Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-2.jpg)

**●** Screen splitting

Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.

**●** Filling the vertical space

If needed, you can creatively fill the vertical space when the shot is not a close one. One of the ideas is by raising the camera of your phone high and then moving it down that will give a deep frame. You can also fill up the vertical space below.

**●** Side-to-side fast movements must be avoided

Since the width area in the vertical videos is less, it is also better to avoid the fast side-to-side movement as it will create a shaky and blurry effect.

![Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-5.jpg)

**●** Make use of text and graphics

To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.

![Use Text and Graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-6.jpg)

**●** Grab attention

It is important for the videos on the social media sites to instantly catch the attention of the viewers, else they will move on to the next one. So, ensure that your vertical videos are eye-catchy and interesting with bright colors, looping animations, GIFs, and other content that is likely to hook up the viewers.

![Grab Attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-7.jpg)

**●** Rule of Thirds

As per the photography rule of thirds, the main subject is not to be placed at the center and instead it the entire frame is divided into thirds using imaginary horizontal and vertical lines. The subject should be placed on these lines or where the lines meet. Use the guide grid on your phone’s camera to use this rule.

![Rule of Thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-8.jpg)

**●** Using a professional video editing software

The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it's considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.

## Online video editor JayCut review

![jaycut online video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/jaycut.jpg)

**Pros**: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.

**Cons:** If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.

**Conclusion:** Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It's fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.
