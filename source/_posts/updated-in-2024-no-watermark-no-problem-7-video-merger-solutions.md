In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself.

On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.
