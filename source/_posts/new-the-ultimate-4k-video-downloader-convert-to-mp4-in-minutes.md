## Merge Videos Without Watermarks: 7 Top Picks

Sometimes, when delving into the vast space of internet and trying to find the perfect online platforms or software in order to edit some videos, it might get frustrating to find only the ones with watermark. But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png)

These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.

**Step 1: Open Photos App**

Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.

**Step 2: Make a New Project**

Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Add Clips**

Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.

**Step 4: Make a Storyboard**

After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg)

The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg)

* **Free Video Cutter Joiner**

[Free Video Cutter Joiner](https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/) – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.

So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg)

Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-4.jpg)

Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-5.jpg)

* **Clideo**

[Clideo](https://clideo.com/) is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.

As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg)

Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they're in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-7.jpg)

* **Typito**

[Typito](https://typito.com/) is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.

To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-8.jpg)

Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-9.jpg)

Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.

* **Online UniConverter**

Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg)

The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg)

Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.

* **Wondershare Filmora**

Last but not least – [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ! Even it differs from other abovementioned video mergers, as in it is not totally free and adds a Filmora logo on exported project, it’s a great suggestion for people who want to make their videos look great with the help of various tools.

Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.

**Step 2: Make a New Project**

Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Add Clips**

Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.

**Step 4: Make a Storyboard**

After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg)

The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg)

* **Free Video Cutter Joiner**

[Free Video Cutter Joiner](https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/) – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg)

Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.

Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-5.jpg)

* **Clideo**

[Clideo](https://clideo.com/) is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.

As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg)

Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they're in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-7.jpg)

* **Typito**

[Typito](https://typito.com/) is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.

To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-8.jpg)

Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-9.jpg)

Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.

* **Online UniConverter**

Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg)

The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg)

Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.

* **Wondershare Filmora**

Last but not least – [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ! Even it differs from other abovementioned video mergers, as in it is not totally free and adds a Filmora logo on exported project, it’s a great suggestion for people who want to make their videos look great with the help of various tools. When a user is ready to pay, Filmora offers a subscription model, and for a bit more, one can get a permanent license. The software costs $51.99 per year or $79.99 for an outright purchase (prices are regularly discounted).
