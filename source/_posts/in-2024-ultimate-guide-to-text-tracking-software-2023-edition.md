Have you ever been mesmerized by a video with text or emoji’s moving together with objects? That effect is produced using motion tracking and isn’t very complicated. Today, we will introduce some text motion tracking software (free & paid) tools that allow you to pin text to video with minimum effort. There will also be detailed tutorials on how to utilize each tool. Let’s get started.

## Best Text Motion Tracking Software \[+Howtos\]

**Note:** The list below is in no particular order.

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Pricing:** Free (watermark) /starts at $49.99/year

**Operating System:**  Windows & Mac

The newly released Wondershare Filmora X version has added the motion tracking features, which allows you to track moving objects in a video clip, and attach images, texts, elements and videos to follow the movement path.

#### How to Use Filmora Video Editor To Do Text Motion Tracking?

* Import the video footage to the timeline and then click the Motion Track icon in the tool bar to enable the Motion Tracking option.

* In the preview window, drag and adjust the tracking box to select a moving object as the target.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-motion-tracking-box.jpg)

* Click the Start Tracking menu to start the moton tracking render, and Filmora video editor will compute the moving path automatically
* Now, go to the Titles tab and drag a subtitle, titles, lower 3rd, or callout to the track just above the motion-tracked video. Customize your texts, adjust its size, position, etc. in the preview window.

* Next, double click the video footage to enter the Motion Track option. Select the title as a follower. Playback the video, and you will see the text will move accordingly.

Below is a step by step video tutorial about how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora. Keep watching.

### 2. Premiere Pro CC

**Pricing:** 14-day trial, minimum $20.99/month

**Operating System:** Windows, Mac

Adobe Premiere Pro is an industry-leading video editor. Premiere Pro CC has all the editing tools a pro video editor needs.

There is no automatic tracking feature in Premiere Pro to pin text to video. Therefore, you need to manually position your text and add keyframes frame by frame. But the overall effort required and the final result isn’t much different from traditional editors.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Premiere Pro CC? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video to the timeline
* Add text by Pressing ‘T’ on your keyboard and clicking on the preview window (your footage)
* Change the position & duration of the text layer on the timeline according to the position & duration of motion tracking
* Make sure you’re on the frame you want to start tracking from
* Click on your text layer → then go to effects controls
* Change the position of the text to the point you want to track → click on the stopwatch icon to add a keyframe
* Move a few frames forward → adjust the position again → add another keyframe
* Don’t put the keyframes too close or too farther apart
* Play through to check it out → adjust the position and number of keyframes if any issues arise

The whole process is relatively easy, although tedious. But the process becomes very complicated when you have more dynamic motion in your clip

### 3. After Effects

**Pricing:** 7-day trial, $20.99/month (individual)

 **Operating System:** Windows & Mac

Adobe After Effects is an editor that focuses on animation & creative composition. This app has been developed as a companion to Premiere Pro for creating short & flashy motion graphics and visual effects for projects.

Motion tracking in After Effects can be done using the Point Tracker, which has one-point and up to four-point tracking. Other tracking options include the built-in 3D Camera Tracker that lets you reverse engineer a scene and the spline tracker that enables you to track masks on an object. There is also Mocha AE, a planar tracker from BorisFX. The Point Tracker is the most flexible and versatile in After Effects. We’ll use it to pin text to video.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? \[Main Steps\]

* Create a new composition/open an old one and make sure your clip is imported
* Create a null object by right-clicking on the window (screenshot below)
* Select your clip → click on tracker → click on track motion
* Two square boxes will appear
* Move the squares to the point you want to track (make sure to select an object with relatively high contrast for easier tracking)
* Position the smaller square on the object you want to track
* Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame
* Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)
* If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on
* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.

* Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame
* Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)
* If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on
* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.

## Top 4K Video Editing Software in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

We have listed the top best 4k video editing software for beginners and professionals based on its features, pros, cons and price. Let's check it in detail.

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The latest version of Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the stripped back, simpler option for video editors who do not want the complexity, advanced features and extra cost of the professional video editing software. It features an interface that has been created for ease of use, but there is also the option to select between Expert or Quick editing modes, depending upon your skill level and needs.

![ Filmora 9  4K video Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9-editing.jpg)

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to **3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)** or **4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)** based on your need.

![ Filmora9 4K Project settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg)

Not sure the differences between these two options, check our guide about [What is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get a clue.

The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click **Match to Media** to change the project settings quickly.

![ Filmora 9 change project settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-change-project-settings-match.jpg)

Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can [create proxy files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

When exporting to 4K Ultra High Definition Quality, just click the Settings button in the Export window to enter the Settings window to adjust the resolution to 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160\. Besides, you can also change the frame rate and bit rate as well.

![ Filmora 9 Export 4K videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-4k-videos.jpg)

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease.

You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.
