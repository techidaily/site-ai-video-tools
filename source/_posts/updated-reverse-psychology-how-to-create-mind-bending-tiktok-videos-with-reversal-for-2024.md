With cool effects and filters, it’s possible to create a wide range of videos that catch the viewer’s attention and put a smile on his face. On the other hand, videos can be created and shared from mobile phones in seconds, enabling its users to show a lot of different situations and express a lot of ideas.

## How to Make A Reversing TikTok Video?

Changing the direction of the video, i.e. playing it backwards, is not hard to achieve on TikTok at all. In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.

To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.

After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.

## How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?

TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.

The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like [Reverse Vid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948) from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.

## How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?

Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.

In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.

Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.

## Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?

In some cases, reversing the audio stream could make the video even more impressive but unfortunately, TikTok doesn’t directly support this possibility. However, more [advanced editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html) for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.

First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.

To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select **Speed and Duration**. In the Custom Speed window, check the **Reverse Speed** option and click **OK** to save the changes.

Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.

If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can [detach the audio from the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) first and then reverse the video separately.

When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.

## How to Reverse A TikTok Video on Snapchat?

To share a TikTok video on Snapchat, you should first download the TikTok video and then open Snapchat.

Go to Snapchat Memories and access the camera roll, and then choose the TikTok video. Click the three dots button on the top right of the screen and then click Edit Video. In the editing mode, swipe the screen to left, you will see the video in slow motion, fast motion, and then the rewind effect. Now, the uploaded TikTok is reversed on Snapchat.
