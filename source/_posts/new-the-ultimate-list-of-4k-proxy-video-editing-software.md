Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.

## The Best Video Editing Apps for Proxy Editing in 2020

Some of the video editing apps we featured in this article can only run on computers that already have the advanced hardware setups. However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.

#### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $49.99 per year

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the **1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions** and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.

#### 2. [Adobe Premiere Pro CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 per month, different subscription plans available

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the **Media Browser** and then click on the **Ingest button**. You should then click on the **wrench tool** and pick the **Create Proxies option** from the drop-down menu located next to the **Ingest option**. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the **Toggle Proxy button**.

#### 3. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/lae/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** Free trial available, $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to **generate optimized media files** by transcoding the original video clips into **Apple ProRes 422 codec** format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The **proxy media files** will also be created by transcoding the videos to **Apple ProRes 422 codec format** that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes **all mp3 files** you import into a project to **MOV audio files**.

#### 4. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/)

**Price:** Subscription plans start from $249,00

**Compatibility:** Windows

This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to **import the files** into a new project, **select each file** you want to transcode and then choose the **Create Video Proxy** option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.

#### 5. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, macOS, Windows

Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only **25% of the video’s original size**, although you can also create proxies that have **50% and 75%** of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the **Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices** button.

#### 6. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor **supports 4K and ProRes files** that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to **export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original**. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to **make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file**, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.

#### 7. [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month

**Compatibility:** Linux, macOS, Windows

The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the **Media submenu** and select the **Make Proxies** option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.

#### 8. [HitFilm Express](https://fxhome.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the **Assets menu** that is located in **the Media panel** and click on the **Make Proxy option**. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.

**Conclusion**

Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing? Leave a comment below and let us know.

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month

**Compatibility:** Linux, macOS, Windows

The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the **Media submenu** and select the **Make Proxies** option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.

#### 8. [HitFilm Express](https://fxhome.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the **Assets menu** that is located in **the Media panel** and click on the **Make Proxy option**. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.

**Conclusion**

Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

Finding effective ways to [promote the videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you create is almost as important as the quality of the movies you make.

Due to its multiple features, everyone wants to have Filmora for editing their content. But not all features of this video editing software are free. However, you can [get Filmora for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)using Torrent.

So, if you are looking for a **Filmora** **torrent**, then don't worry. We have got you covered. We have discussed the setbacks and the methods to get Filmora for free in this article. Let's dive in.

* [Part 1: Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent](#part1)
* [Part 2: Amazing Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2021](#part2)

---

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

## Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022

You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:

### 1\.  AI Portrait

AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to [remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can also add glitch effects, noise, pixelated borders, segmentation video effects, and many more using AI Portrait on Wondershare Filmora.

This feature helps you change the settings of effects and customize it according to your needs. For example, if we are talking about the noise, you can change the Percentage, Edge Thickness, Edge Feather, and Alpha with the help of this tool.

This add-on works perfectly for single and real objects facing the camera. Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.

You can manually change the focal point of the video or opt for an aspect ratio that meets your requirements with the help of Auto Reframe.

This feature also helps you select the focal point depending on the platform you want to share your video on. It allows you to adjust the video's speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.

For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.

### 3\.  AR Stickers

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**. However, by selecting delete effects, you will remove all the applied effects, i.e., other than AR stickers.

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.
