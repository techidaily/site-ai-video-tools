## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

## How to split large video files in Windows Live Movie Maker

### Step 1\. Add photos and videos to Windows Live Movie Maker

Click "Add videos and photos" to browse and select videos and photos from your computer to add. You can also drag and drop videos and photos to the storyboard.

### Step 2\. Split videos in Windows Live Movie Maker

There are two ways to use Windows Live Movie Maker split function: 1\. Choose the video point where you want to split, right-click the video clip, and click "split". 2\. Select the video point you will split. Under "Video Tools", click the "Edit" tab, and then click the "split" button.
