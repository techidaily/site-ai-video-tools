## 10 Best Meme Generator Apps for Android and iOS

Choosing a meme generator is not easy because there are simply too many great apps for both iOS and Android devices that let you have complete control over the entire process of generating a meme. We've selected the 12 best options that are currently available on GooglePlay and AppStore.

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memedroid-funny-memes-gif-maker.jpg)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices?

The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.

## Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024

Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS

The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.

#### 2. [Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 10

Even though the Photos App doesn’t offer a lot of video editing options you can still use it to process the footage you recorded before sharing it online. The app’s Edit&Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.

#### 3. [Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 8/7

It’s already been a couple of years since the Windows Movie Maker was discontinued, but despite that this video editing software remains one of the best options for novice video editors who are still using Windows 8 or older versions of the Windows OS. Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.

#### 4. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) –Best Free Open Source Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020

Transcoding video files or automating video editing tasks is the most common reason why inexperienced video editors opt for Avidemux. This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.

## Best Cheap Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020
