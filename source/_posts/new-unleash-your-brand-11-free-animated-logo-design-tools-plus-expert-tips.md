## Part 4: 4 Tips on Making Animated Logo

### 1\. Make a short and beautiful animated logo

You don't want people to watch a long animated logo video as viewers need to wait for a long time to know your real meaning. You just need to make an animated logo as short as possible. However, shortness doesn't mean it is plain. You can still express brand and product meaning very well with beautiful design and reasonable logo shape. To do that, you need to understand the meaning behind your logo.

### 3\. Branding your company

Whatever you do, [you should keep in mind that branding comes first](https://uxplanet.org/dont-stay-still-why-brand-needs-an-animated-logo-91cf3c7f69b7?gi=1cace4ea840d). An excellent animated logo can add a powerful branding impact to your company. In return, more and more people will come to your company and like it. It is a virtuous circle. If you still don't know the importance of the brand, now it is time to animate the logo!

### 4\. Make a good impression

A good first impression will give viewers more chances to know your company. Let's say, if you don't like your logo, the possibility of losing potential customers will be higher. A good impression means your animated logo quite fits the company style or the industry style, so you need to know what part of your company can arouse the user's feelings.

### 1\. Which software is best for logo animation?

Logo animation software is not short on the ground. Most regular editing programs will have features that let you add an animation to your logo. We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation. You may even be able to use the free version of this software without paying for the whole program.

Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.

### 2\. How do I make an animated logo?

When you are using Filmora Pro as your logo animation software, there are steps you need to take to achieve full animation. First, prepare your file by opening a new workspace with a web resolution of about 320 x 240\. Select your background layer, then add in any graphics or art you have for your logo. Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.

You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.

### 3\. How do I make an animated logo for free?

PixTeller is such an excellent service because it has logo animation software that is free to use. It allows you to work with all types of formats. So if you have a logo as a JPEG, or whether you want to draw it out in vector graphics, you can do so.

## Final Verdict

We would here like to state that you can use Wondershare Filmora if you want to make a breathtaking intro video. This software is the best choice for its 2D and 3D intro logo effects package. Also, we hope that by now, you have decided which to use and started working on your logo intros. You can share with us if we missed any other logo animation maker and if you like this post. Thanks!
