### 1\. Which software is best for logo animation?

We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation.

Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.

Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.

You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.
