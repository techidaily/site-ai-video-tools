## Part 2: How to Install Android Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

Editing videos on a Chromebook can be beneficial for so many different reasons, but at the moment only a few Chromebooks allow you to use Android video editor apps. Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let's go through it step by step.

#### Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App

The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don't. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings.jpg)

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.

## Part 2: How to Install Android Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

Editing videos on a Chromebook can be beneficial for so many different reasons, but at the moment only a few Chromebooks allow you to use Android video editor apps. Even if your Chromebook supports Android apps it is possible that some apps cannot work properly on a Chromebook. Installing apps from a Google Play Store can at times be a somewhat complicated process so let's go through it step by step.

#### Step 1 Getting the Google Play Store App

The process of acquiring the Google Play Store app is different for Chromebooks that support Android app and for those that don't. It is of utmost importance to make sure that the OS you have on your Chromebook is at least version 53 or more recent, otherwise, you will not be able to get the Google Play Store App.

#### 1\. If your Chromebook supports Android apps

Once you've made sure that your Chromebook has the OS that supports Android apps, go to Status area, and look for the Settings cog. After the Setting window opens, click on the 'Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook' check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option. This action will open the Google Play Store app and you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions, click **Agree** and proceed to download the apps you want.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings.jpg)

#### 2\. If your Chromebook doesn't support Android apps

The process of gaining access to Google Play Store is more complicated if the Chromebook you have doesn't allow its user to run Android apps. In order to start this process, you first need to switch to the Developer Channel, which has its own risks. Back up all your data, before switching to developer channel, because returning to a stable channel requires you to do a factory reset.

To make the switch you'll need to go to Status area and click on Settings, this action will open the Settings page. Once the page is displayed on your screen click the About Chrome OS tab that shows which version of the OS you have installed on your Chromebook and which channel you are currently running.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-2.jpg)

Click on More Info to expand the info about the Chrome OS, and look for a Change Chanel option. Clicking on the Change Chanel button will present you with three options Stable, Beta and Developer-unstable, select the last option, read the warning dialog box carefully and click Change Channel.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-3.jpg)

Once all the necessary updates to put the device into Developer Channel are completed, you will be required to restart your Chromebook. After you have restarted your Chromebook, go to the Apps tray and you will see that Google Play Store app is now available. Click on it and go through the Terms and Conditions and click on accept.

![install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-android-on-chromebook-settings-accept.jpg)

#### Step 2 Getting Android Video Editing Apps

If you already have a Google Play Store account on your Android Smartphone, your Chromebook will automatically recognize it and allow you to log in, but if this isn't the case you'll have to set up a new account.

![android-on-chromebook-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-on-chromebook-interface.jpg)

The process of getting android video editing apps is simple and very similar to the installation process of an app on an Android phone. Locate the app you want to install and click on the Install button. The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that's the only action you'll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you'll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook. Click on it to run the app and you are all set to start your first video editing journey on your Chromebook.

Keep in mind that how apps perform will largely depend on the Chromebook you have, so before choosing to download and install an Android video editing app, make sure that your device is capable of delivering a solid performance. Share with us about your opinion in the comment section below.
