## Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives

Not impressed with VLLO and looking for alternatives? Well, here are the two best applications that have the capabilities to impress you. First on the list is among the most powerful video-editing tools on the internet, and second Apple’s own free program for Mac users. Read on to find which one is the best for you!

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \[YouTubers & Vloggers\]

Wondershare Filmora for Mac is recognized as the best [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software for beginners and intermediates in the industry. The reason: be it the interface, supported formats, features, or export options — the Filmora for Mac is superior in comparison to regular software.

The AI-backed interface is intuitive enough to allow even beginner-level video editors to utilize the application to the fullest; plus, it is powerful enough to impress expert video editors. Also, the software supports all video, audio, and image formats, so you do not have to waste your time with encoding before proceeding to edit the videos. Coming to the features — to sum up in brief — the Filmora for Mac contains all that is expected from video-editing software.

[![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png) ](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8)

**Why should I use the Filmora for Mac instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* Filmora has an intuitive, modern interface that makes things like rotating, merging, trimming, splitting, cropping, and flipping videos effortless and convenient for newbies, semi-pros, or pros.
* The software is free to utilize
* Auto-color and color correction options to tune your video exactly as you want
* Easiest keyframing experience of any software; one-click options preset options to create custom animations
* The application allows you to record a voiceover directly into your project timeline.
* You can remove video noise from your footage.

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)\[Beginners\]

Apple native iMovie is a simple and basic video editing tool that can well compete with the likes of VLLO. But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.

In all, the application is suitable for the users who do not need powerful editing features or take much control of what’s happening in the video. Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.

![imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-3.jpg)

**Why should I use iMovie instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* First things first, iMovie interface will be much more convenient to the users on MacBook instead of the smartphone-type interface of the VLLO
* The app has all the basic editing options needed to enrich the footage looks
* Free to utilize application, no ads like VLLO

## Conclusion

VLLO may be a great tool, but it is not the only application. As indicated, software tools like Wondershare Filmora for Mac are powerful, simple, and include features that allow you to videos like a professional within minutes. Whereas the iMovie is another simple option suitable mostly for typical users who only need basic options. But if you are serious about video editing or want to edit videos like a professional by tailoring every detail exactly like you want - Filmora for Mac is the way to go!
