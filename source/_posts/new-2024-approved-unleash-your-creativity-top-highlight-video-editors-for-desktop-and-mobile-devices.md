If your highlight video is about a conference, it is essential to know when speakers will deliver the speech, etc.

**Make a list of shots**

**Use the right equipment**

You need to use proper equipment for the events to ensure the footage looks great in low light. Gather all your equipment before the event and make sure it is fully charged and functional. Carry the extra batteries and other tools as well.

## Part 4: How to Share and [Download Your WhatsApp Status Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

WhatsApp debuted the 'Status' feature a few years ago. Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends' statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.

Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.

**Method 1: Save It with File Manager**

Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone's storage.

Step 2: Open your **File Manager app**. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.

Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.

**Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App**

Step 1: First, download the app ['Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US).' And open the app and grant it storage access.

Step 2: In order to save someone's WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.

Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.

## Part 5: FAQs about WhatsApp Status

**Who can see my WhatsApp status?**

It's only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other's phone numbers in your phone's address book.

Unless you change this setting, your status updates are visible to everyone on your contact list.
