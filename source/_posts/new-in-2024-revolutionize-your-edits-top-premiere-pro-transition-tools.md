There are even online **MP3 to MP4 converters** that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

## Trim Your Videos for Free: 10 Best Online Video Editors

# 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers to Edit Videos Quickly

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

## Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?

There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.

It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.

If this article helped you, then feel free to share our 10 best free online video trimmers article on social media. Let your friends know which free online video trimmer you like the best.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

## Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?

There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.

It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.
