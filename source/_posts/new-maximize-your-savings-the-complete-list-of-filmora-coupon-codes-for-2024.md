## In This Article, I Will Share Top 40 Keyboard Shortcuts for Final Cut Pro and I've Categorized Them to Make These Easier to Find

# Top 40 Keyboard Shortcuts for Final Cut Pro X

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")
