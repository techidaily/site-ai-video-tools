_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Got confused by manual adjustments? There is an alternative solution if you also hate the manual process of color adjustments in CyberLink PowerDirector. Go no far than the professional yet beginner-friendly [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to check in for automatic color match adjustments. Yes, you don't have to go for separate adjustments in RGB Channel, etc., as you have done before.

The Wondershare Filmora is also one of the most considerable video editors in the professional industry. It comes with pretty intuitive advanced editing tools such as **Video Stabilization**, **Color Tuning**, **Color Matching**, **Green Screen**, **Key** **Framing**, and **Motion Tracking,** etc., to name a few.

Turn on the **Comparison View** and move the slider given in the preview section. To match color settings, click on **Match** and wait a few seconds to let it see the same in both the **Reference** and **Current** preview window.

So, this is all you need to do as an alternative for the **PowerDirector color match**. The color match settings in Wondershare Filmora are relatively automatic and do not require additional RGB Channels adjustments.

## Conclusion

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Get below a detailed Chromecast app list. It tells you how to stream local files to TV through Chromecast from PC, Mac, Android, or iPhone, iPad and more. Now the Google cast supported video formats are limited to MP4 and WebM. If you have the format incompatibility issue, just use [Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)to convert your video to be supported by Chrome.

To stream local files to TV from PC or Mac, there are totally 4 ways to choose from. Just get the 4 solutions below.

* [Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV](#part1)
* [Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter](#part2)
* [Solution 3: Cast with Plex for Chromecast](#part3)
* [Solution 4: Cast with Videostream for Google Chromecast](#part3)

## Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV

![cast chrome browser to tv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/connect-chromecast.jpg)

### Step 1\. Install Chrome browser and Chromecast extension

Make sure that you have the latest version of Chrome. You can check by clicking Settings > About Google Chrome to update your chrome.

### Step 2: Connect Chromecast with TV

Plug in Chromecast in the HDMI input on your TV, and then plug the USB cord on the other end of the Chromecast to power it.

![cast from chrome browser](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/cast-browser.jpg)

### Step 3.Connect WiFi

Make sure that your computer and TV are connected in the same network. You should be connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi network.  
If your Chromecast can't be connected to the Wi-Fi network, please [check the Chromecast router compatibility here](https://support.google.com/chromecast/table/3477832?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=3205565).

### Step 4.Install Google cast extension

After installation, there will be a Cast tab on the Chrome browser. You can click the option button to set video quality as Extreme (720p high bitrate) or High (720p) for your HD TV.

![cast from chrome browser](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/cast-video.jpg)

### Step 5\. Play local Video or music

Drag your local files to chrome browser, or press Ctr + O to browse and import your files. And then your video will be played in Chrome's built-in video viewer. Then click the Cast current tab on your browser to stream media files to Chromecast and then play it on TV.

Also you can choose Cast entire screen to share your desktop screen instead of a Chrome tab to TV.

**Note:**

1\. If your videos can't be streamed, that's because Chromecast doesn't support these formats. [You can check all the supported media here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media). If you really want to cast any format, check the second solution.

2\. Stream video in background: When you stream video to your TV, you can use the 2 Windows short cuts to stream local video to Chromecast in background.  
Alt+Tab: It lets you do other things by switching to other opened programs/apps  
Ctrl+Esc: You can start a new program by pressing the 2 buttons to pop up the Star menu.

## Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter

<

Download and install [Wondershare UniConverter Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) from its official website page.
