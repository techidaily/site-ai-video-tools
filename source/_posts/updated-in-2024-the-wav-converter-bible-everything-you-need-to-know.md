## **Conclusion**

Editing videos on 32-bit Windows may be challenging for a variety of reasons, especially if your PC doesn’t have a lot of RAM. What’s more, finding a video editing software that can run on Windows 7 and older versions of the OS is becoming increasingly difficult because you can’t use most video editing apps unless you have 64-bit Windows installed on your computer.

Hopefully, this article has helped you find the best 32-bit video editing software for Windows that can meet all of your video editing demands. Are you editing videos on the 32-bit version of Windows? Leave a comment below and share your experiences with us.
