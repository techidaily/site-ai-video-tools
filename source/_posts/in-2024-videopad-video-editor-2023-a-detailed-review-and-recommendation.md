This nch video editor comes with a free basic plan where you don't have to pay anything, so you can try to see how it works. In this article, we will do a quick review of this video editing software so that you have a better understanding of its features.

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

## **Our Recommendation**

Filmora video editor is free to download, so you can try out all the features without paying a penny. However free version will have a watermark when you export the video. You will have to purchase a subscription to get rid of the watermark. If you compare the features and user-friendliness of both these video editors, then Filmora definitely stands out by all means. In addition to its feature richness, it also has a user-friendly interface that beginners can easily adapt to. So, don't waste your time and give it a try right now.

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

Next, select the "Copy Link" option of the Facebook video that you want to download and convert!

![Facebook Post - Copy Link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%206.png)

**Step 3: Use Facebook Video Converter!**

Next, paste the URL of the Facebook video onto your chosen Facebook Video Converter (as is shown in the image below!)

![Use Facebook Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%207.png)

**Step 4: Use MP4 to MP3 Converter!**

Once you've had your Facebook video converted into an MP4, all you need to do is upload that MP4 files to a free converter (like the one shown in the image below, URL provided!) In this way, you achieve Facebook to MP3 conversion!

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

0 0

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

**●** Don't hesitate to try out other types of tools as well! Including software, like Filmora Pro, or the chrome extensions that we introduced.

But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

### 7. [Cyberlink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

PowerDirector 365 is a professional video editor in the Cyberlink family. It is a great [Final Cut Pro alternative on Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Back in 1999, Apple launched Final Cut Pro, and the software didn't take so long to become the first choice for video editors and post-production agencies.

The main feature it has that makes it stands out from any other video-editing software out there is that it is made exclusively to operate on Mac only, and that allowed Apple to make it fully enhanced for speed and efficiency enabling it to[**edit 4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **UHD footage** with no rendering issues.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.
