Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

01 [What is OGG?](#Part 1)

02 [Eight Online and Free OGG to MP4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.
