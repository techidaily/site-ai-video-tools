Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

If you need to cartoon your video, you can try Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The newly released Filmora professional video editing software can allow you to turn videos into cartoons with ease. The processing of converting videos into cartoon style is easy, just import the videos into Filmora, and then add the Cartoon effect under Stylize. Adjust the cartoon settings and do some basic color corrections to perfect the cartoon result.

It is important to be patient and go through this stage of the process slowly in order to avoid making mistakes.

### 10\. Adobe 2D Animation Software

**Price:** Free trial, $20.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Even though Adobe 2D Animation Software has an intuitive interface that doesn’t take much time to get used to, creating cartoons from photos with Adobe’s highly praise animation app can be an overwhelming task if you don’t have previous experience.

What’s more, you’ll have to convert your photos into vector drawings before you can import them into Adobe 2D Animation Software and use them to make a cartoon. Once you arrange all the images in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the final video, you can proceed to use the lip-sync features, synchronize the sounds with the movements of your characters or utilize the Bone tool to make the movements more fluid.
