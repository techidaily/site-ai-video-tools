Deciding which option to go for when you have two high-performance video editing software like LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X can be a tough choice to make.

LumaFusion was originally a hands-on video editing app on iOS, adapted to iPad and iPhone alone. At the same time, Final Cut Pro X was designed to run on Mac.

With the recent compatibility of LumaFusion on the M1 MacBook Air, which surfaced in 2020, there have been recent concerns from expert users that very soon, these iOS Pro editing giants may lock horns in no time; if the latter sees more advanced upgrades.

This article will be giving you a concise yet comprehensive comparison of this editing software, what features to expect, and professional advice to help you choose which one suits your editing needs. Stick with me as I take you on this brief journey into the creative world of LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X.

## **Pros and** **Cons** **of** **Final Cut Pro X and** **LumaFusion**

| **Pros of LumaFusion**                             | **Pros of Final Cut Pro X**                 |

| |                                                  |                                             |
| **Cons of LumaFusion**                             | **Cons of Final Cut Pro X**                 |
| Difficult with large projects and multi-task       | Relatively expensive                        |
| Advanced features like motion tracking and missing | Advanced tools are unfriendly for beginners |
| Advantages like touch control are limited in Mac   | Exclusively on Mac                          |

Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.

However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.

But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.

## **Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion**

**Final Cut Pro X Price**

Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.

Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.

![FCPX price](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20price.jpg)

During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.

**LumaFusion Price**

Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.

For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.

![lumafusion pirce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download%20lumafusion.jpg)

Though it comes with no trial policy, recent updates and fixes show that LumaFusion can generally be a dominating app in the editing world.

Plus, you can always try Filmora for free, it's popular among beginners and professionals!

## **Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion: Interface**

 **Final Cut Pro X**

Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.

![FCPX interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20interface.jpg)

Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.

Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.

**LumaFusion**

LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.

![Lumafusion interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Lumafusion%20interface.jpg)

Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.

However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.

## **Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion**

**Is LumaFusion worth it?**

It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.

Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.

Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.

However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.

 **Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?**

High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.

So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.

Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.

Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.

LumaFusion was originally a hands-on video editing app on iOS, adapted to iPad and iPhone alone. At the same time, Final Cut Pro X was designed to run on Mac.

With the recent compatibility of LumaFusion on the M1 MacBook Air, which surfaced in 2020, there have been recent concerns from expert users that very soon, these iOS Pro editing giants may lock horns in no time; if the latter sees more advanced upgrades.

This article will be giving you a concise yet comprehensive comparison of this editing software, what features to expect, and professional advice to help you choose which one suits your editing needs. Stick with me as I take you on this brief journey into the creative world of LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X.

## **Pros and** **Cons** **of** **Final Cut Pro X and** **LumaFusion**

| Advanced features like motion tracking and missing | Advanced tools are unfriendly for beginners |
| Advantages like touch control are limited in Mac   | Exclusively on Mac                          |

Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.

However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.

But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.

## **Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion**

**Final Cut Pro X Price**

Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.

Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.

![FCPX price](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20price.jpg)

During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.

**LumaFusion Price**

Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.

For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.

![lumafusion pirce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download%20lumafusion.jpg)

Though it comes with no trial policy, recent updates and fixes show that LumaFusion can generally be a dominating app in the editing world.

Plus, you can always try Filmora for free, it's popular among beginners and professionals!

## **Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion: Interface**

 **Final Cut Pro X**

Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.

![FCPX interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20interface.jpg)

Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.

Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.

**LumaFusion**

LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.

![Lumafusion interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Lumafusion%20interface.jpg)

Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.

However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.

## **Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion**

**Is LumaFusion worth it?**

It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.

Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.

Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.

However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.

 **Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?**

High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.

So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.

Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.

Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.

When you're taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you'll need to decide if it'll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that's where the knowledge regarding the **phone aspect ratio vertical** comes in!

![phone aspect ratio vertical](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone1.jpg)

This post will dive into the rise of the phone aspect ratio vertical, including best practices on using **phone ratio calculator** and **mobile vertical video size** based on its final viewing platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or broadcast.

01 [Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?](#Part 1)

02 [Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens](#Part 2)

03 [Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video](#Part 3)

04 [Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.

## Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video

Besides using the **photo ratio calculator**, we'd like to enlist some tips on getting started with your **phone aspect ratio vertical** shooting.

1 – High production quality is not essential

Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don't be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.

2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions

Whether it's **iPhone vertical video dimensions** or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.

3 – Engage your audience better

You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.

4 – Optimize vertical videos

You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won't achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don't.

5 – Capture Attention

Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it's the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don't underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.

## Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone

Are you looking to capture the video in the correct **phone aspect ratio vertical**? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.

1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio

Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.

It's possible to create vertical videos two ways:

**●** By framing a camera in portrait mode.

**●** By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.

2 – Split the screen

You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.

Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.

You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.

3 - Fill the vertical space

You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.

![fill vertical space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg)

When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.

The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.

![image pov](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg)

4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)

While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.

While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.

Slow down when in doubt!

![do not shake camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg)

5 - Remember to resize as per the platform

You don't essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm's length when you shoot videos vertically.

Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.

Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.

6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers

Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn't highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.

Line them up where they'll improve your video and scale them up as required.

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)

While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.

While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.

Slow down when in doubt!

![do not shake camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg)

5 - Remember to resize as per the platform

You don't essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm's length when you shoot videos vertically.

Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.

Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.

6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers

Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn't highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.

Line them up where they'll improve your video and scale them up as required.

Focus and exposure points can be easily adjusted, and you could record your next slow motion video while the previous one is being rendered.

Remember that the frame rate is dependent on the iOs devices. That's 120 fps for the iPhone 5s+, 60 fps for the iPhone5/5c and iPad mini, and 30 fps on the other Apple devices.

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on How to Convert Facebook Video to MP3**

To start, let's talk about how you can convert a Facebook video into an MP3! For this, we'll be using one of the Facebook Converters that we'll be introducing in the lists near the end of the article. As well illustrate just how the general process goes (it's the same for most online Facebook video converters!)

**Step 1: Log in to Facebook!**

First of all, you'll of course need to be logged in for your Facebook account!

![Facebook Log-in Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%201.png)

**Step 2: Open Desired Video!**

Next, go and select the Facebook video that you want to convert into a video! Once you've found it, click on the "..." (options) menu on the bottom right corner of the video feed (as is shown in the image below).

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%202.png)

**Step 3: Copy Direct Video URL!**

Once the options menu has been opened, select the "Copy Link" option (pointed out in the image below.) You'll need this URL in order to use most **Facebook Audio Converter** tools and plug-ins.

![Facebook Post - Copy Link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%203.png)

**Step 4: Plug Facebook URL!**

Next, plug the direct URL of the video that you want to download on your chosen **Facebook MP3 Converter** and click the download/convert button!

![Use Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%204.png)

## Part 2 **How to Download and Convert a Facebook Video Online**

Next up, we'll be going through the entire process once more. However, this time, we'll be teaching you how to download and convert a Facebook Video Online. Again, this is pretty easy, all you need is the right **Facebook Audio Converter** and a functional online MP4 to MP3 converter.

**Step 1: Go to Facebook Video!**

Like before, we start with getting the direct URL of your chosen Facebook video! For this, remember to first select the "..." menu!

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

Next, select the "Copy Link" option of the Facebook video that you want to download and convert!

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on How to Convert Facebook Video to MP3**

To start, let's talk about how you can convert a Facebook video into an MP3! For this, we'll be using one of the Facebook Converters that we'll be introducing in the lists near the end of the article. As well illustrate just how the general process goes (it's the same for most online Facebook video converters!)

**Step 1: Log in to Facebook!**

First of all, you'll of course need to be logged in for your Facebook account!

![Facebook Log-in Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%201.png)

**Step 2: Open Desired Video!**

Next, go and select the Facebook video that you want to convert into a video! Once you've found it, click on the "..." (options) menu on the bottom right corner of the video feed (as is shown in the image below).

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%202.png)

**Step 3: Copy Direct Video URL!**

Once the options menu has been opened, select the "Copy Link" option (pointed out in the image below.) You'll need this URL in order to use most **Facebook Audio Converter** tools and plug-ins.

![Facebook Post - Copy Link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%203.png)

**Step 4: Plug Facebook URL!**

Next, plug the direct URL of the video that you want to download on your chosen **Facebook MP3 Converter** and click the download/convert button!

![Use Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%204.png)

## Part 2 **How to Download and Convert a Facebook Video Online**

Next up, we'll be going through the entire process once more. However, this time, we'll be teaching you how to download and convert a Facebook Video Online. Again, this is pretty easy, all you need is the right **Facebook Audio Converter** and a functional online MP4 to MP3 converter.

**Step 1: Go to Facebook Video!**

Like before, we start with getting the direct URL of your chosen Facebook video! For this, remember to first select the "..." menu!

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

Next, select the "Copy Link" option of the Facebook video that you want to download and convert!

![Facebook Post - Copy Link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%206.png)

**Step 3: Use Facebook Video Converter!**

Next, paste the URL of the Facebook video onto your chosen Facebook Video Converter (as is shown in the image below!)

![Use Facebook Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%207.png)

**Step 4: Use MP4 to MP3 Converter!**

Once you've had your Facebook video converted into an MP4, all you need to do is upload that MP4 files to a free converter (like the one shown in the image below, URL provided!) In this way, you achieve Facebook to MP3 conversion!

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter.
