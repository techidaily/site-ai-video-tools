# How to Add Titles in Final Cut Pro X

We add text titles to our projects to tell the audience something they can't figure out on their own, such as the title of our program, the name of the person speaking, or technical details about a subject.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.

#### DEFINITIONS

Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:

* Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.
* Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called "supers" or "keys."
* Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.
* Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the "lower-third" of the screen.
* Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.

#### JUST THE BASICS

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg)

I'd like to introduce "Yertle," he's a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

I'd like to introduce "Yertle," he's a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.

There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software youâ€™re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.

## Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers

Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story. Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools youâ€™re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, letâ€™s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, iOS

Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the directorâ€™s name and create the end credits.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovieâ€™s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.

Want to know the details? Check the detailed guide about [how to make a movie trailer with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $49.99

You wonâ€™t need much time to get used to VSDCâ€™s interface even if you donâ€™t have any previous video editing experience. The video editor supports nearly all popular video file formats, and at the moment it is the only free video editing software that allows you to export 4K videos without watermarks. Moreover, making a movie trailer with VSDC is remarkably easy, as you just have to arrange the footage on the timeline, apply visual effects and create an opener and the end credits. The software doesnâ€™t offer templates, which means that you have to go through this process manually. VSDC lets you choose from a variety of export profiles that optimize your movie trailers for playback on Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms. Whatâ€™s more, the software enables you to upload projects directly to YouTube, which can save you a lot of time on rendering movie trailers.

### 4\. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:** $299 - 599

**Compatibility:** Windows

Film industry professionals donâ€™t need a special introduction to Vegas Pro since this video editing software was and still is one of the best video editors for Windows ever created. That is why it is hardly a surprise that you can use Vegas Pro for much more than just making movie trailers. In fact, it is hard to imagine a video editing task you cannot perform with this video editing software. Vegas Pro lets you edit and export projects in resolutions that go as high as 8K, while it also provides a broad range of advanced video editing options, such as complete HDR support or planar motion tracking. In addition, Vegas Pro is compatible with Boris FX, AutoLooks OFX and numerous other plug-ins that enable you to create professional-looking movie trailers.

### 5\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is arguably the most famous video editing software of all time that is frequently used to create movie trailers or entire full-feature movies. The software supports all video file formats, even those created by professional video cameras like Red Dragon or Arri Alexa. Adding and arranging video clips on the timeline wonâ€™t take too much effort, and you can also apply transitions between shots, or perform color correction in the softwareâ€™s Lumetri panel. Adobe Premiere Pro features an impressive collection of visual effects, and all projects you create with this video editor can be opened in Adobe After Effects where you can create Hollywood-like visual effects for your movie trailers. However, youâ€™re going to need advanced video editing skills in order to create a movie trailer for the project youâ€™re working on in Adobe Premiere Pro.

### 6\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

The video editor allows you to have complete control over each step of the movie trailer making process and enables you to make openers, apply a visual effect, create soundtracks and much more. Sadly, Final Cut Pro X doesnâ€™t offer movie trailer templates, although you can save all your projects, which enables you to create your own movie trailer templates. In case you donâ€™t have a lot of video editing experience, it is better to opt for a movie trailer maker that doesnâ€™t require you to have an advanced set of video editing skills.

### 7\. [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $23.99

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Even though Avid Media Composer isnâ€™t the most famous video editing software we included in this article, the features it offers stand shoulder to shoulder with those provided by Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Both free and paid versions of Avid Media Composer are aimed at professional video editors, while some of the subscription plans are best suited for large media houses that have large teams working on the same project. Unsurprisingly, this video editing software is compatible with a broad range of audio and video plugins that extend its capabilities even further. Making a movie trailer with Avid Media Composer isnâ€™t a task for an inexperienced video editor, but seasoned film industry professionals are going to have a lot of fun creating movie trailers with this video editing software.

### 8\. [HitFilm Pro](https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-pro)

**Price:** Pricing options start at $390.00

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The seemingly never-ending list of video editing features this software offers includes compositing and layering options, 3D camera projection or Behavior effects to mention a few.

The software grants you access to professional text and titling options which enables you to create unique opening titles or end credits for movie trailers you make with HitFilm Pro. Nonetheless, this video editing software is only suitable for industry professionals with years of experience.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Donâ€™t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. Thatâ€™s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audienceâ€™s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isnâ€™t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldnâ€™t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailerâ€™s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software youâ€™re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovieâ€™s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Donâ€™t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. Thatâ€™s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audienceâ€™s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isnâ€™t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldnâ€™t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailerâ€™s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software youâ€™re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.
