As per research, audio plays a more vital role than the visuals in a video. Yes, no one will ever like a video that gets the audio track unrelated to the moving clip or has no voice. Similarly, suppose you are shooting or recording a live video. In that case, the most off-putting factors like **background noise**, **improper microphone**, and various distractions from the environment can affect the video or the movie quality.
