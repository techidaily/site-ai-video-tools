Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Wax is a light weight but high performance and flexible video editing, composition and special effects software. And above all, it's a free video editor for both commercial and personal use. Wax can create 2D & 3D special effects and can work in two modes - as a standalone application and as a "plug-in" to video editors/NLEs like VirtualDub, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, etc.

 This is the getting-started tutorial for Wax. In this Wax tutorial, we are going to show you how to zoom, crop and pan video and image, how to make project settings and how to render AVI videos.

---

 Note: If you think Wax is something complicated, you can turn to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which enables you to edit videos with separate tracks and add transitions to your videos, finally, convert your video to any video format you like.Download the free trial version of Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) (Windows/Mac) below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

#### 1. Zoom, crop and pan image for video

 Download Wax and install it first. Run the software and Load Media Files by right-clicking on MediaPool panel. But this doesn't finish. To edit video, you need to drag-n-drop desired media files to the timeline. Then switch to Video Plugins to drag-n-drop Quick 3d plugin to the just added track.

![wax free video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/wax.jpg)

 As shown above, click the triangle next to Quick 3d, you would see many options such as Posx, Posz, Cropleft, Cropbottom, etc. Please see detailed instructions to make editing in Wax:

**Zoom Video**: Click the Posz clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

**Crop Video**: Click the Cropleft/Croptop/Cropright/Cropbottom clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

**Pan Video**: Click the Posx clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

 Note that you could preview the video while making settings in the top preview windows.

#### 2. Make project settings

 Press F3 or click the Project Settings button in the tool bar to bring up the dialog. There, specify the file name, save path and video options, including video dimensions, frame rate, and click OK.

![how to use wax](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/wax-settings.jpg)

#### 3. Render AVI video

 Click the green arrow button on the tool bar to start saving video to specified path in the project settings. A few minutes later, you will get the edited video.

![wax video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/wax-render.jpg)
