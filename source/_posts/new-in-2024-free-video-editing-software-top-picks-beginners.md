![Create transitions in FCP](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-1.png)

It is possible to apply transitions with a simple shortcut; all that you need to do is either blade your video clip into several scenes as per need or add two or more different scenes to be joined to your software timeline.

It is desired because the transition effect can be applied only if you have more than one clip on the timeline. Also, you can see more [keyboard shortcuts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

![Blade your clip ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-2.png)

Once you have obtained your two scenes for which you need to add transition effect then select the very first scene from the timeline. Now open the Video animation window on your device, it can be done by pressing Shift+V; find the Compositing option, and then apply default transitions by simply dragging timeline handle towards both sides of the composite window. In FCP, Cross dissolve will be selected as the default transition.

#### **Part 2: Use Browser to Apply Transition:**

* Go to the media toolbar and then hit the transition icon. It can be identified as a shaded box over which X is written.

![Transition icon ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-4.png)

* Now choose your favorite transition from Browser and drag it to your timeline.
* It is time to place the dragged transition between two video clips that you need to edit here.

**In order to change the duration of transition:**

* Simply right-click on the timeline and select the Change duration option.

![Change duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-5.png)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent.

Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.

![ Filmora 9  4K video Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9-editing.jpg)

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to **3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)** or **4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)** based on your need.

![ Filmora9 4K Project settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg)

Not sure the differences between these two options, check our guide about [What is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get a clue.

The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click **Match to Media** to change the project settings quickly.

![ Filmora 9 change project settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-change-project-settings-match.jpg)

Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can [create proxy files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

When exporting to 4K Ultra High Definition Quality, just click the Settings button in the Export window to enter the Settings window to adjust the resolution to 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160\. Besides, you can also change the frame rate and bit rate as well.

#### 2\. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease.

You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

It features an interface that has been created for ease of use, but there is also the option to select between Expert or Quick editing modes, depending upon your skill level and needs.

![ Filmora 9  4K video Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9-editing.jpg)

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to **3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)** or **4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)** based on your need.

![ Filmora9 4K Project settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg)

Not sure the differences between these two options, check our guide about [What is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get a clue.

The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click **Match to Media** to change the project settings quickly.

![ Filmora 9 change project settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-change-project-settings-match.jpg)

Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can [create proxy files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

When exporting to 4K Ultra High Definition Quality, just click the Settings button in the Export window to enter the Settings window to adjust the resolution to 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160\. Besides, you can also change the frame rate and bit rate as well.

#### 2\. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.
