Yes, broadly Windows Movie Maker can be considered like iMovie as both of these are video creating and editing tools. The major difference between the two lies in the supported platform, Windows Movie Maker is for the Windows system while iMovie comes pre-installed with the Mac systems.

#### 2\. Is Video editor better than Movie Maker?

Both Windows Movie Maker and Video Editor can be used for editing videos, images as well as sounds but the major difference between the two lies in their main purpose of use. While the Windows Movie Maker is mainly used for creating new movies, the Windows Video Editor is majorly used for editing and customizing the existing files.

#### 3\. Does Windows Movie Maker have a watermark?

No, Windows Movie Maker does not have a watermark.

## Final Words

For Windows system users, Windows Movie Maker is the first and default choice when it comes to video editing. So, now if you have switched to a Mac system there are alternatives in fact even better tools available to customize your files. You can make a choice between the above-listed Mac alternatives based on your requirements.
