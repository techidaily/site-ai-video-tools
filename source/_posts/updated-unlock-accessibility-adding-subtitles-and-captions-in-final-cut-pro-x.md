Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

### Step 3.Connect WiFi

Make sure that your computer and TV are connected in the same network. You should be connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi network.  
If your Chromecast can't be connected to the Wi-Fi network, please [check the Chromecast router compatibility here](https://support.google.com/chromecast/table/3477832?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=3205565).

### Step 4.Install Google cast extension

### Step 5\. Play local Video or music

Drag your local files to chrome browser, or press Ctr + O to browse and import your files. And then your video will be played in Chrome's built-in video viewer. Then click the Cast current tab on your browser to stream media files to Chromecast and then play it on TV.

**Note:**

2\. Stream video in background: When you stream video to your TV, you can use the 2 Windows short cuts to stream local video to Chromecast in background.  
Alt+Tab: It lets you do other things by switching to other opened programs/apps  
Ctrl+Esc: You can start a new program by pressing the 2 buttons to pop up the Star menu.
