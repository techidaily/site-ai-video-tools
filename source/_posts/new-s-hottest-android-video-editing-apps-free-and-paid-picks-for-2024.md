## Part 1: Recommended Desktop Video Editing Software for Android Videos

On an Android phone, editing videos can be a bit difficult due to the restrictions of the screen.

All you need is to plug in a USB and let the program detects video files located in your Android phone, and then import them to the program for editing.
