## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming. Even though there are restrictions as to the content to upload, you can find all the information you need either as a tutorial, music or graphical representation.

#### 1.[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/watch) – Video hosting site Live Streaming Platform

![video hosting service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-interface.jpg)

Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone's disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It's not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.

File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.

Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.

![video hosting platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-interface.jpg)

Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.

The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19/Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150/Month, Plus at $850/Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.
