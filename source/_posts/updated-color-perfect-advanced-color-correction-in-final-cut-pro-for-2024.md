Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

The steps below can help all beginners to develop easy video edited projects using Final Cut Pro, but if some of you find this platform a little difficult then it is good to start practicing as a beginner on [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”. ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![ Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

## 3GP Video Cutter Software: A Review of the Best Tools

# 3GP Cutter: How to Cut 3GP Files

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

3GP(3GPP file format) is a multimedia container format used by mobile phones. It is a simplified version of the MP4 format and was designed to make file sizes smaller so mobile phones could support video. In this article, we will introduce a very easy-to-use tool: Wondershare 3GP cutter and splitter, which can be used to split large 3GP video clips into smaller files, or to extract key messages from any videos with a .3gp extension. Follow the steps we are about to outline and you will have no issues with your 3GP video cutting experience.

To get started, download and install this smart 3GP cutter -[Wondershare Filmora (for Win and Mac)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). And then follow the step-by-step tutorial below to chop your 3GP files.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### How to cut 3gp file with Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)

#### 1\.  Add 3GP files to Wondershare 3GP cutting tool

There are two different ways for you to add 3GP files to this 3GP splitter. Hit the “Import” button on the main menu of the interface to browse your computer and then import your wanted 3GP files to this app’s album. Or you can also add your files by directly dragging and dropping them into this app’s album.

![3GP splitter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-video-1.jpg)

#### 2 Cut 3GP video clips

Drag one of the source 3GP files from the album to the timeline at the bottom. And then move the top of the red Time Indicator to put it at one point you want, click the scissor-like icon, move the Time Indicator to another point, and hit the scissor icon again.

## Image Ratio Mastery: Learn to Calculate, Find, and Adjust Like a Pro

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.
