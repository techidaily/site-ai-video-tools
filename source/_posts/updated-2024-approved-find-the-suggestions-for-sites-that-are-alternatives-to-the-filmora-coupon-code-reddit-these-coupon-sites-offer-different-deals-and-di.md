## 10 Best Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android

Sharing the raw footage, you capture on a Smartphone with your friends and followers may not always produce the results you’re hoping for. Slowing down the playback speed can make a scene more entertaining or highlight an important moment in your video. Increasing a video’s playback speed is a great option if you want to create breathtaking time-lapses. So, let’s take a look at the **10 best video speed-changing apps for slow and fast motion video editing on iOS and Android devices.**

### 1\. Filmora for mobile

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

This app provides a versatile set of video editing tools, enabling you to **enhance the colors in your videos**, make a soundtrack or even **[create a PIP effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

KineMaster is one of the[best video editing apps for iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android devices you can find on the market.

Changing a video clip’s playback speed with this app is a simple three-step process. After you import a video clip into the app, you will be taken to the Adjust Speed screen, where you can choose if you want to alter the playback speed of an entire video clip or speed up or slow down a particular segment of a video.
