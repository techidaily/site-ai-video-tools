## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**Step 3**: Export the video files when you’re done. Click on **Export** and save the looping video as a video or gif, and then select the location where you want to save the file.

**Summary**

Depending on your taste, the number of video loops required, and the amount of information you need when creating a full-fledged film with repeats, you can use any software described above. If you need a more advanced option, Wondershare Filmora video editor is your best alternative in terms of **Video Loopers**. It is not only a free video looper, but it also has several additional capabilities that allow you to create a full output with granular changes.

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

![windows 10 photos finish video export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-finish-video-export.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Boomerang Loop with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Looping a movie is not a difficult chore for anyone, even a novice. As we all know, most video players cease playing when a video approaches its climax. You can manually reverse the portion if you wish to see it with Boomerang effects.

You may loop and enjoy the video you like continuously when you do a new project in [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editor for all video content creators.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step 1**: Launch the Filmora video editor and import the video file. Click on **File>Import Media>Import Media Files**. And then drag the video file to the timeline. Do some basic editing such as trimming and cutting to get the segments that you want to loop with the Boomerang effect, if necessary.

**Step 2**: Copy and paste the video file on the timeline, and then change the speed of the pasted video to apply the Reverse effect. Repeat the process to loop the video as many times as you want.

## The Ultimate Time-Lapse Video Editing Software Roundup

# Best Time-Lapse Video Editing Software in 2024

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

## Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024

There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either **record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval**, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let's take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.

#### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): Best Time-lapse Software for Beginners \[Windows & Mac\]

**Price:**  Freemium

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you're using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you're producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That's why you need **30 or 24 photos** for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor's timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.

![ Filmora Timelapse video making](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   **Duration setting**, and then **set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds**.

Click OK to continue, and you'll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you'll see the time-lapse video is made already.

![ made  Timelapse video with Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-make-timelapse-video-with-photos-1.jpg)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are working with video files, you should **double the playback rate** to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you've recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.

You can check the details about two ways of [making a time-lapse video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/): Best Free Time-lapse Software for Mac

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS and iOS

iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn't mean that you can't use iMovie to create time-lapse videos.

All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate.

Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   **Duration setting**, and then **set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds**.

Click OK to continue, and you'll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you'll see the time-lapse video is made already.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are working with video files, you should **double the playback rate** to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you've recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.

You can check the details about two ways of [making a time-lapse video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/): Best Free Time-lapse Software for Mac

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS and iOS

iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn't mean that you can't use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor's timeline and change their duration to **0.1** seconds from the **Clip Information panel**.

However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only **10 frames per second**, so to [speed it up](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you first have to export the video you've created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.

Afterward, you can select the **Custom option** from the **Speed menu** that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.

If you want to edit videos further with iMovie, here is a brief tutorial about [How to Use iMovie to Edit Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/): Free Time-lapse Video Editor for Windows

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  Windows

This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of **AVI video files** and sets of **BMP image files**. Even though VirtualDub doesn't offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.

Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you'll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the **same size**. Besides, you'll have to set up the **video's [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and compression manually**, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That's why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.

#### 4. [GoPro Quik](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/quik-%7C-desktop/Quik-Desktop.html) : Best Video Editor for Creating Time-Lapse Photos Shot With GoPro

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS, Windows

GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like **rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards** to record the time-lapse footage properly.

GoPro's Quik video editor features all the tools you're going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add **panning effects** to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.

#### 5. [Final Cut Pro X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12) : Best Professional Video Editing Software for Time-lapse Video on Mac

**Price:**  $299.99

**Compatibility:**  macOS

Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the **Retime** submenu that is located in the **Modify drop-down menu** and select one of the **Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast** options.

You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you're working on.

Learn more details about [Making a Time Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 6. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) : Best Professional Video Editing Software for Time-lapse Video on Windows

**Price:**  $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

The way you capture your photos and organize them is crucial in creating a time-lapse video in Adobe Premiere Pro. You must **arrange all the photos numerically**, and once you're ready to import them into the software, you must make sure that the **Image Sequence checkbox** is selected. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically generate a video from the photos so you can add a video file to the timeline instead of hundreds of still images. This professional video editing software provides with a broad range of video editing tools you can use to **simulate camera movement, perform color correction or control the video's playback speed**. The process of creating a time-lapse video with Adobe Premiere Pro isn't complicated, but you must be prepared for each step of this process if you want to go through it smoothly.

#### 7. [LRTimelapse](https://lrtimelapse.com/)

**Price:**  Free trial available, subscription plans start at $99.00

**Compatibility:**  macOS, Windows

The time-lapse photos you take with your camera must be edited before you can turn them into a video. LRTimelapse software is designed to reduce the amount of time you have to spend editing the footage. It allows you to process each image in [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and then import those edits into the project you created in LRTimelapse. Furthermore, this app for PC and Mac computers lets you **fade in and fade out time lapses, adjust the white balance throughout the sequence you're creating, or get rid of the unwanted flickering effect**. LRTimelapse allows you to export videos in resolutions up to 8K, making it a perfect choice for all filmmakers and photographers in need of powerful time-lapse post-production software.

**Conclusion**

Preparation is the most important segment of the time-lapse video production process. The photos or video clips you want to include in the video must be captured perfectly to depict the passage of time seamlessly. Moreover, the video editing software you choose must provide you with all the tools you're going to need to create a professionally-looking time-lapse video. Each of the time-lapse post-production software products we featured in this article enables you to create a time-lapse video with ease.

03 [5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC](#Part 3)

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**●** FREE to try, multiple-packages available

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

![Audiotool Audio Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2012.png)

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below).

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

02 [6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**●** FREE to try, multiple-packages available

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Premium software (subscription/one-time fee)

**●** Advanced tools might make it harder to get used to

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

![Audiotool Audio Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2012.png)

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)
