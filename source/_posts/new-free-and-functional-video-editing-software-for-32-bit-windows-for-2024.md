**Takeaway**

Is the storage space in your Windows PC running out? If that's the case, AceThinker Video Master is a fantastic tool for you. It's essentially four video apps in one package.

### 8\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

**User Review**

A [TrustRadius Ratings and Review](http://trustradi.us/A9272) says, "Lightworks is a great tool for a non-designer to use because it provides a number of tools and capabilities that can be quickly learned." However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

### 9\. [Flexclip - Easy-to-Use Online Editor](https://www.flexclip.com/)

**User Review**

FlexClip being an online video editor means one thing; it does not use your PC's processing power. It also delivers what it promises. A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

### 10\. [WeVideo - Best for Templates](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

**Takeaway**

Some tools are intimidating for beginners; there are many buttons, and you don't know what each one does. That's not a problem when using OpenShot. Its simple interface is easy to understand, making it the best tool for beginners.

However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

**User Review**

FlexClip being an online video editor means one thing; it does not use your PC's processing power. It also delivers what it promises. A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.
