Start by browsing through the online photo collage maker’s library of templates, and click on the one that you want to use. Once the template opens you can **upload the pictures** from your computer or from Facebook and Instagram. You’ll also be able to add **new shapes and text layers** to the template or change its background. Each visual or textual element you decide to include in your photo collage can be edited so that it fits the visual style of the collage perfectly. **The watermark is going to be added** to all your creations if you decide to use the free version of Photovisi.

Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than **250 photo collage templates** that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.
