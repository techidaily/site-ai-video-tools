<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes full versions of each software similar to the apps or games you normally download or buy through the App Store. As of now, the bundle and its apps have unlimited ownership and access.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I update apps in the education bundle?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Go to Finder &gt; App Store. Type any app in the bundle, for example, Final Cut Pro, in the search bar. In the search results. Locate the app, and if Apple released an update for Final Cut Pro, there would be an ‘Update’ button. Click it, and the app will be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I download the pro app bundle on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Unfortunately, no. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education is only available for MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, and Mac Minis. Apple has not released or will never make their proprietary software for Windows and other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I buy the bundle with friends because I don’t need all the apps?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education is delivered to you in an email as a list of unique redemption codes for each software. One of the major issues associated with purchasing Apple professional software (such as Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio) is that the license isn’t transferable. Your purchase can only be moved from one personal Mac to another—not given away or combined with someone else’s ID. Once you buy it, your Apple ID will forever stay attached to this product, and all its limitations are yours as well.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window"><a href="#1Select-Window" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import"><a href="#2-Import" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel"><a href="#3Capture-Panel" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips"><a href="#6Marking-Clips" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out"><a href="#7-In-and-Out" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips"><a href="#8Playing-Clips" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>

<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging"><a href="#12Nudging" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit"><a href="#14Add-an-edit" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>

<h4 id="16-Match-Frame"><a href="#16-Match-Frame" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<hr>
<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-1"><a href="#1Select-Window-1" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-1"><a href="#2-Import-1" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-1"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel-1"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip-1"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips-1"><a href="#6Marking-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out-1"><a href="#7-In-and-Out-1" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-1"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-1"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-1" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-1"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-1" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence-1"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence-1" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-1"><a href="#12Nudging-1" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection-1"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection-1" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene.

<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>

<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-2"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>

<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel-2"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>

<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip-2"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip-2" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips-2"><a href="#6Marking-Clips-2" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out-2"><a href="#7-In-and-Out-2" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-2"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-2" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>

                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence-2"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-2"><a href="#12Nudging-2" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection-2"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection-2" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit-2"><a href="#14Add-an-edit-2" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>

<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition-2"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame-2"><a href="#16-Match-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence-2"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit-2"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit-2" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim-2"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim-2" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-3"><a href="#1Select-Window-3" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-3"><a href="#2-Import-3" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="6.

As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="7.

Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>

<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

<p>Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to <strong>3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)</strong> based on your need.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-1"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>
<p>And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.</p>

<p>Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to <strong>3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)</strong> based on your need.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-2"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg"
                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>
<p>And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.</p>

It features an interface that has been created for ease of use, but there is also the option to select between Expert or Quick editing modes, depending upon your skill level and needs.</p>

<p>Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to <strong>3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)</strong> based on your need.</p>

<p>The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click <strong>Match to Media</strong> to change the project settings quickly.</p>

<p>Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create proxy files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1&#x2F;6 quality for smoother editing.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-3"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg"
                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?"></a>1.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?</h4><p>Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-3"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>
<p>And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.</p>
