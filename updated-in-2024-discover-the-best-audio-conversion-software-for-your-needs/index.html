With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio?

There are just too many of them! No one has the time to go and test each and every single one of them! (Aside from us!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fortunately, in terms of features, there are really only three that you have to think about: speed, flexibility, and bonus features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The abundance of choices at least makes sure that each <strong>audio auditor</strong> is able to meet the specific needs of a certain group of users! To imitate this fact, our list of <strong>audio converters</strong> was compiled specifically so that we could offer as much variety as possible. With hints along the way to make sure that everyone has an audio converter that suits their own projects.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-3"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade. As a converter true and true, it is capable of more advanced conversions. Case in point, the software supports over 300 audio formats (including some of the obscure ones!) It also offers basic video and audio editing for perfecting projects!</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Stop-Motion-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Stop-Motion-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Use Stop Motion Studio?"></a>Part 2. How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/download-stop-motion-studio.jpg"
                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video"><a href="#1-Merge-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert"><a href="#3-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>

You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute.

<p>The videos you record with your phone often don’t last very long, which makes it a bit difficult to tell the entire story of the scene you captured. Fortunately, there are more than a few simple ways to combine and merge multiple clips, that don’t involve using professional video editing apps. So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video-3"><a href="#1-Merge-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert-3"><a href="#3-Aconvert-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing-3"><a href="#4-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/kapwing_1.jpg"
                      alt="kapwing_1"
                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>
<h4 id="5-Cellsea-3"><a href="#5-Cellsea-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Cellsea"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor" >Cellsea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip-3"><a href="#6-FlexClip-3" class="headerlink" title="6. FlexClip"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html" >FlexClip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Before you can start piecing together your video clips with this online video editing tool, you must first create an account or use your Google and Facebook accounts to sign in. You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>
