<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<h2 id="Part-2-Download-and-Install-Videoleap-for-MacBook"><a href="#Part-2-Download-and-Install-Videoleap-for-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook"></a>Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook</h2><p>As I have listed above, <strong>Videoleap for MacBook</strong> is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:</p>
<ul>
<li>BlueStacks</li>
<li>Nox Player</li>
<li>MEmu Player</li>
<li>ARChon Player</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-2.jpg"
                      alt="download bluestacks"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download bluestacks on Mac"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Access Google Account"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Install Videoleap for MacBook via BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>That’s it! Once you have configured Google Play, you can just launch it, and look for “Videoleap” from the search bar. After finding the app, you can click on the “Install” button and wait as <strong>Videoleap for MacBook</strong> would be downloaded.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Install Videoleap"
                ></p>
<p>After Videoleap is installed on BlueStacks, you can launch it, and start editing your videos without any hassle.</p>

<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>There you go! I’m sure that after following this guide, you can easily use <strong>Videoleap for MacBook.</strong> Since Videoleap is only available for iOS and Android devices, I have come up with a stepwise approach to install it on Mac.

Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:</p>
<ul>
<li>BlueStacks</li>
<li>Nox Player</li>
<li>MEmu Player</li>
<li>ARChon Player</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="download bluestacks"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Install Videoleap for MacBook via BlueStacks</strong></p>
<p>That’s it! Once you have configured Google Play, you can just launch it, and look for “Videoleap” from the search bar. After finding the app, you can click on the “Install” button and wait as <strong>Videoleap for MacBook</strong> would be downloaded.</p>
<p><img
