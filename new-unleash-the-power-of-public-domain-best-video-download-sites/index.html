<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering.

Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage.

That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/" >FAQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-3"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay-3"><a href="#6-Vidsplay-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

Within the Moving Image Archive, you can find different collections that contain full feature movies, art videos, animations, cartoons or television footage.

The Moving Image Archive can be an excellent source of footage for anyone who wants to download <strong>public domain video clips</strong> and use them in their commercial or non-commercial projects.</p>
<h4 id="8-PublicDomainFootage-3"><a href="#8-PublicDomainFootage-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p>
<h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p>

Categories like Cityscape, Animals or Water contain hundreds of stock videos, so you just have to open one of the available categories and locate the video clip you want to download. However, you must first create an account on Motion Elements before you can save video files to your computer. In addition, the platform doesn’t allow you to make more than five downloads per week and you must invite your friends to join the platform if you want to increase the weekly number of downloads. Even so, Motion Elements is a great source of stock footage you can use without any restrictions.</p>

Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.</p>

<p>Apple launched an advanced video editing tool, <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong>, back in 1999 and it didn’t take very long to get popular and gain recognition among the photographers and videographers. Later in 2003, Final cut pro beats Final Cut Express, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click to learn why <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best features that help it stand out from the rest of the video editors is that it is supported by all Mac systems and has permitted Apple to make it fully enhanced in terms of efficiency and speed, enabling it to edit even 4K UND footage without any rendering issues.</p>
<p>Along with such exciting advantages, the video editing tool comes with several disadvantages too. It is complex to understand especially for beginners and most importantly it keeps crashing, corrupting the file even if it is saved properly on your Mac system, which can lead to your entire work being lost. Several Final Cut Pro X users complain that their work gets corrupted as the video editing tool keeps crashing after intervals.</p>
<p>If you can relate to this scenario, you will find this blog post helpful as we have listed some methods that can possibly fix the crashing problem and save your hours of video editing efforts. Keep reading to know the steps that can prevent your video editor from crashing.</p>

If your Final Cut Pro X video editor and program tool also keep acting up, it can probably be because of the corrupted preferences file.</p>
<p>A corrupted preferences file occurs when you do not reset your preferences and settings in the first place. Not resetting the preferences can corrupt the file and end up crashing the video editing tool, damaging the whole video.

<p>Apple launched an advanced video editing tool, <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong>, back in 1999 and it didn’t take very long to get popular and gain recognition among the photographers and videographers. Later in 2003, Final cut pro beats Final Cut Express, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click to learn why <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best features that help it stand out from the rest of the video editors is that it is supported by all Mac systems and has permitted Apple to make it fully enhanced in terms of efficiency and speed, enabling it to edit even 4K UND footage without any rendering issues.</p>
<p>Along with such exciting advantages, the video editing tool comes with several disadvantages too. It is complex to understand especially for beginners and most importantly it keeps crashing, corrupting the file even if it is saved properly on your Mac system, which can lead to your entire work being lost. Several Final Cut Pro X users complain that their work gets corrupted as the video editing tool keeps crashing after intervals.</p>
<p>If you can relate to this scenario, you will find this blog post helpful as we have listed some methods that can possibly fix the crashing problem and save your hours of video editing efforts. Keep reading to know the steps that can prevent your video editor from crashing.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Does-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keep-Crashing-3"><a href="#Why-Does-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keep-Crashing-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?"></a>Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?</h2><p>According to Final Cut Pro X users, the video editor is a reliable and solid program, but it can be really frustrating for them when it keeps crashing. If your Final Cut Pro X video editor and program tool also keep acting up, it can probably be because of the corrupted preferences file.</p>
<p>A corrupted preferences file occurs when you do not reset your preferences and settings in the first place. Not resetting the preferences can corrupt the file and end up crashing the video editing tool, damaging the whole video. All those who want to troubleshoot and require methods to fix the crashing issue should take a few steps to resolve the problem which leads us to our second section.</p>
<h2 id="What-to-Do-if-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keeps-Crashing-on-Your-Mac-System-3"><a href="#What-to-Do-if-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Keeps-Crashing-on-Your-Mac-System-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Do if Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing on Your Mac System?"></a>What to Do if Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing on Your Mac System?</h2><p>One of the major issues in Final Cut Pro X is the crashing problem on the Mac system. If you encounter this problem and learn to isolate, troubleshoot, and fix this issue following the below methods, you will likely resolve the crashing problem on your own. However, you should always ensure keeping a back-up of your Final Cut Pro X media, libraries, and applications as a whole in order to keep the data before following the below steps.</p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Resetting-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Preferences-and-Settings-3"><a href="#Method-1-Resetting-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Preferences-and-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resetting Final Cut Pro X Preferences and Settings"></a>Method 1: Resetting Final Cut Pro X Preferences and Settings</h3><p>As mentioned above, resetting the preferences and settings can help in resolving the crashing issue. Resetting preferences will not affect your projects, libraries, or media. With resetting, we mean that you should change the custom preference settings to the default settings. Before you take the plunge to reset your preferences, you should choose Final Cut Pro over Preferences and note all the specific settings that you have to make.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to reset the preferences in Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Quit working on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold down the option and command keys, then open the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the delete preferences option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the last step, recreate the issue that you were having during video editing. If the problem is resolved, you should open Final Cut Pro preferences and apply the custom settings again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> And, it’s done!</p>
<p>This method will reset all your preferences to default settings and this way it will empty the list of the recent libraries and media. Though the entire libraries are not erased, you will be able to find them in the specified location when you first created them. But they will only be there if you have created a back-up of your data. That is why we mentioned in the beginning to create a back-up of your Final Cut Pro data in the first place.</p>
<p>With the help of fixing the Final Cut Pro X preferences, you will be able to fix a lot of your problems especially the crashing one. The preferences are deeply embedded into the program operation even if we cannot directly amend most of them.</p>

Here are the steps that you should follow to restart your Mac system:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the Apple menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reopen the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reproduce the issue and see if the problem still exists.</p>
<p>If your Final Cut Pro X acts up on your Mac system, you should try restarting the system following the aforementioned steps. In case, restarting doesn’t fix the issue, you should apply the first method.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<hr>
<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window"><a href="#1Select-Window" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import"><a href="#2-Import" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-3.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel"><a href="#3Capture-Panel" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-4.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips"><a href="#6Marking-Clips" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out"><a href="#7-In-and-Out" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips"><a href="#8Playing-Clips" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging"><a href="#12Nudging" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit"><a href="#14Add-an-edit" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame"><a href="#16-Match-Frame" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>

<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-1"><a href="#1Select-Window-1" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-1"><a href="#2-Import-1" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-1"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel-1"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip-1"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips-1"><a href="#6Marking-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out-1"><a href="#7-In-and-Out-1" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-1"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-1"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-1" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-1"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-1" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence-1"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence-1" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-1"><a href="#12Nudging-1" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection-1"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection-1" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit-1"><a href="#14Add-an-edit-1" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition-1"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame-1"><a href="#16-Match-Frame-1" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence-1"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence-1" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit-1"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit-1" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-1"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-1" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim-1"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim-1" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-2"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-2" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>

<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence-2"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-2"><a href="#12Nudging-2" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection-2"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection-2" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit-2"><a href="#14Add-an-edit-2" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition-2"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame-2"><a href="#16-Match-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence-2"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit-2"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit-2" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim-2"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim-2" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>
<hr>
<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<hr>
<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-3"><a href="#1Select-Window-3" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-3"><a href="#2-Import-3" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-3"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-3" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel-3"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel-3" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip-3"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip-3" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips-3"><a href="#6Marking-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out-3"><a href="#7-In-and-Out-3" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-3"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>

<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>

<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-3"><a href="#12Nudging-3" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>

<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add transition to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>A basic lyric video with animated titles, transitions, and effects is made. You can edit further to make the lyrics play through the images. Watch the video tutorial to get more information.</p>
