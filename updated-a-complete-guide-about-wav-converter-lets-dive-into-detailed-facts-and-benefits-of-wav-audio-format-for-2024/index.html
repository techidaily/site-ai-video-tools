<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time. If you are looking for a high-quality and flexible video editor, then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is your only real and viable choice.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye"><a href="#2-Security-Eye" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>

<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>

<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-1"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-1"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-1"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Perfect Surveillance"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/" >Perfect Surveillance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>
<h4 id="5-Xeoma-1"><a href="#5-Xeoma-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Xeoma"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/" >Xeoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>

<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>

<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-2"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-2"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-2"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Perfect Surveillance"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/" >Perfect Surveillance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-2"><a href="#4-iVideon-2" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>
<h4 id="5-Xeoma-2"><a href="#5-Xeoma-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Xeoma"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/" >Xeoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>

<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras.

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-3"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-3"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-3"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-3"><a href="#4-iVideon-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>
<h4 id="5-Xeoma-3"><a href="#5-Xeoma-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Xeoma"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/" >Xeoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>Video cover Facebook size</strong>: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.</p>
<p>File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.</p>
<p>Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.</p>

To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>Video cover Facebook size</strong>: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.</p>
<p>File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.</p>
<p>Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.</p>

Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<p>step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_1.jpg"
                      alt="Skin_Smoother_Effect_1"
                ></p>
<p>step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_2.jpg"
                      alt="Skin_Smoother_Effect_2"
                ></p>
<p>step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.</p>

                      alt="Skin_Smoother_Effect_3"
                ></p>
<p>For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize &gt; Vignette and adjust drag the vignette. Now, customize the compound clip settings in the Inspector pane until you achieve your desired look. Compare the results between two images before and after editing</p>

<ol>
<li>Applying the Beauty Studio effect smoothens all parts of the image including the background. However, it will make your footage look artificial, which is not desired. Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.</li>
<li>Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.</li>
<li>Now, click on View Matte&#x2F;Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.</li>
<li>Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.</li>
<li>To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.</li>
<li>Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.</li>
<li>For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Smooth skin with clear facial expressions attracts everyone. You can apply a skin smooth effect in your video by using advanced video editing tools like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premium, and Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>There are two methods to add a skin smooth effect with FCPX: By using in-built software settings, or by using plugins like Skin Smoother 2, Color Finale, and Universe. Use Beauty Studio Effect in Adobe Pro to smooth skin and improve facial appearance. Finally, you can beautify the face in your video by adding transitions, making color adjustments, and applying different effects with Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<ol>
<li>Applying the Beauty Studio effect smoothens all parts of the image including the background. However, it will make your footage look artificial, which is not desired. Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.</li>
<li>Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.</li>
<li>Now, click on View Matte&#x2F;Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.</li>
<li>Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.</li>
<li>To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.</li>
<li>Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.</li>
<li>For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.</li>
</ol>

Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<p>step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Skin_Smoother_Effect_1"
                ></p>
<p>step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Skin_Smoother_Effect_2"
                ></p>
<p>step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.</p>

                ></p>
<p>For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize &gt; Vignette and adjust drag the vignette. Now, customize the compound clip settings in the Inspector pane until you achieve your desired look. Compare the results between two images before and after editing</p>

<ol>
<li>Applying the Beauty Studio effect smoothens all parts of the image including the background. However, it will make your footage look artificial, which is not desired. Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.</li>
<li>Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.</li>
<li>Now, click on View Matte&#x2F;Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.</li>
<li>Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.</li>
<li>To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.</li>
<li>Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.</li>
<li>For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Smooth skin with clear facial expressions attracts everyone. You can apply a skin smooth effect in your video by using advanced video editing tools like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premium, and Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>There are two methods to add a skin smooth effect with FCPX: By using in-built software settings, or by using plugins like Skin Smoother 2, Color Finale, and Universe. Use Beauty Studio Effect in Adobe Pro to smooth skin and improve facial appearance. Finally, you can beautify the face in your video by adding transitions, making color adjustments, and applying different effects with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
