<p> You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new <em>SHARE</em> button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your <em>SHARE</em> button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; <strong>Option 1: Through the SHARE button</strong> or; <strong>Option 2: On A Separate Platform</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Capture-screenshots-on-PS4-with-SHARE-button"><a href="#Capture-screenshots-on-PS4-with-SHARE-button" class="headerlink" title="Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button"></a>Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button</h2><p> You can’t miss the <em>SHARE</em> button on the new controller for the latest PS4. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on <em>SHARE</em> button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your <em>Share Settings</em> to <em>Easy Screenshots</em> where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.</p>

Simply browse through the screenshot that you’ll like to share or upload and then click once to select it. You can also hit <em>Options</em> instead to preview the details of the screenshot before.</p>

<p><strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong> is one of the most reliable, versatile, and powerful video editing tools. What really makes it more powerful and useful for video editors is the hundreds of third-party plugins that can be easily added to the program.</p>

<p>Here are a few common reasons due to which your plugin may be working partially or completely crashing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inappropriate configuration or settings of the Final Cut Pro X</li>
<li>Conflict with the plugin template</li>
<li>Incorrect code of the plugin by rookie developers</li>
<li>Incompatibility with the latest version of Final Cut Pro</li>
<li>Incomplete installation of the plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code. After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not. If you do not have the latest version of the software, there are chances that the plugin can crash. You should then consider contacting the expert or simply installing the latest version of the plugin that is best supported by the Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>If your plugin does not work, it may be likely due to the aforementioned reasons and causes. But fixing this issue is mandatory therefore, in the next section we have covered a few troubleshooting tips to fix plugins that keep crashing or are malfunctioning.</p>

What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let’s take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:</p>

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs.

So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan-3"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan-3" class="headerlink" title="1.
