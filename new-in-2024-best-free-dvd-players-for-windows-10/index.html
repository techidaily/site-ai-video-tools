<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>
<li>Powerful subtitle syncing tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-PotPlayer"><a href="#2-PotPlayer" class="headerlink" title="2. PotPlayer"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://potplayer.daum.net/" >PotPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you are looking for a DVD player that is compatible with all versions of Windows that were released since Windows Vista, PotPlayer might be one of your best options. Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full OpenCodec support</li>
<li>Provides a unique 3D viewing experience</li>
<li>Enables users to bookmark chapters</li>
<li>Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio playback options could be better</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-BlazeDVD"><a href="#3-BlazeDVD" class="headerlink" title="3. BlazeDVD"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.blazevideo.com/dvd-player/" >BlazeDVD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a powerful multimedia player that enables you to watch even region coded and CSS-encrypted DVDs. However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add subtitles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.</p>
<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children. Creating slideshows from still images or recording videos in an MPEG2 file format are also among the options you are going to have at your disposal if you opt for the paid version of BlazeDVD.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent audio playback capabilities</li>
<li>Features a learning mode</li>
<li>Equipped with the Smart Stretch technology</li>
<li>Multi-core CPU acceleration features enhance the video and audio playback</li>
</ul>

The process will start immediately, and you may be asked to give authorizations to install the app on your Chromebook, but that’s the only action you’ll need to perform during this stage of the process. After the installation is over you’ll find your new video editing app in the App Tray, next to other apps you have on your Chromebook.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage.

<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-3"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="Public Domain Video Download "
                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="2-The-Public-Domain-Review-3"><a href="#2-The-Public-Domain-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-National-Screening-Room-3"><a href="#3-The-National-Screening-Room-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                      alt="National Screening Room Public Domain Video Collection "
                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="5-Pexels-3"><a href="#5-Pexels-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Pexels"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/public%20domain/" >Pexels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay-3"><a href="#6-Vidsplay-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Vidsplay"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vidsplay.com/" >Vidsplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage. The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

Within the Moving Image Archive, you can find different collections that contain full feature movies, art videos, animations, cartoons or television footage. The public domain videos hosted on The Moving Image Archive cover a broad range of topics, but some of them can be in poor resolution. The Moving Image Archive can be an excellent source of footage for anyone who wants to download <strong>public domain video clips</strong> and use them in their commercial or non-commercial projects.</p>
<h4 id="8-PublicDomainFootage-3"><a href="#8-PublicDomainFootage-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

All content on the platform is divided into Archival Footage and Historic Newsreels sections that contain categories like Atomic Age, Civil Rights or Pop Culture. You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p>
<h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-FAQs-About-3D-Movie-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-2-FAQs-About-3D-Movie-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: FAQs About 3D Movie Makers"></a>Part 2: FAQs About 3D Movie Makers</h2><p><strong>1. Which 3D Movie Maker software is the easiest to use?</strong></p>
<p>All the video editing tools you can see here are easy to use. However, Autodesk MotionBuilder and Blender are better for people who are experienced. Beginners can try Vidmore Video Converter and Tipard video converter.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I use 3D Movie Maker freeware or paid ones?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on your requirements. Both paid and freeware video editing tools will allow you to edit your 3D animation videos, but if you have additional requirements and looking for an advanced video editing tool, paid ones will be better suitable. Consider the video requirements you have, and accordingly choose a paid or freeware 3D video editor.</p>
