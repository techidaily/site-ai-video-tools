<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality"><a href="#Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec"><a href="#1-Codec" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container"><a href="#2-Container" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut</h3><p>LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality. It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.</p>

<p>One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.</li>
<li>Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.</li>
</ul>

Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.</li>
<li>Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it’s easy to use and has the best and most useful features.</p>
<p>Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.</p>

<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality">Section 1. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality</a></li>
<li><a href="#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality">Section 2. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality</a></li>

Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec-1"><a href="#1-Codec-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container-1"><a href="#2-Container-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-1"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>

It is a good choice to trim VLC video. You can cut and combine videos without losing the quality. Filmora supports pretty much every video format there is, so you don’t have to worry about codecs and containers.</p>

If you want to trim your video manually, you can just drag the trimming sliders according to how you want to cut the video.</p>

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut</h3><p>LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality.

Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it’s easy to use and has the best and most useful features.</p>
<p>Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.</p>

<p><em>Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?</em> Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.</p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality">Section 1. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality</a></li>
<li><a href="#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality">Section 2. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality-3"><a href="#Section-1-Why-trimming-VLC-videos-will-result-in-loss-of-quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?"></a>Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?</h2><p>To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!</p>
<h4 id="1-Codec-3"><a href="#1-Codec-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Codec"></a>1. Codec</h4><p>Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Container-3"><a href="#2-Container-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p>A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.</p>
<p>Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.</p>
<h4 id="3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-3"><a href="#3-Video-compression-and-re-encoding-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video compression and re-encoding"></a>3. Video compression and re-encoding</h4><p>You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.</p>
<p>When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. <strong>Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.</p>
<p>When you make changes to a video with a <strong>video trimmer app</strong>, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.</p>

<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>

<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals.

<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips-3"><a href="#3-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>

<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>

<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs.

<p><strong>Sponsored messages in LinkedIn:</strong> This type of LinkedIn ad was previously termed as sponsored InMail.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Sponsored content:</strong> These ads show up in the feed of the LinkedIn user. No matter if they are using it on mobile on desktop. These sponsored contents also have a label of promotion on them. This makes them different from the regular contents. If you are choosing sponsored content then you also get the choice between carousel ads, video ads and images ads.</p>

The users get to see their own personal details as soon these ads pop up on the screen. This can even be changed through the settings so that the details get hidden if the user finds this to be very personal. Dynamic ads are also of two types. One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.</p>

These ads are shown on the top and right side of the feed of LinkedIn. Approximately 58% of the companies say that making the lead generation better is the top priority of digital marketing.
