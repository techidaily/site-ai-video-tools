Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection"><a href="#3-Make-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="chromebook-connection"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software.

<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-2"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>

<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-2"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>

<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-2"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-2"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

<p>We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.</p>
<p>Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.</p>

<p>However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.</p>

<p>You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.</p>

You should start by choosing one of the available titles from Filmora’s Title tab and placing it on the timeline.</p>
<p>Double-click on the title you added, then click on the Advanced button and insert the text into the textbox. Proceed to set the text color to white, adjust its size and select a new font and then make sure that the No Animation option is selected in the Animation tab.</p>

<p> Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.</p>
<p>Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.</p>
<p>Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.</p>
<p>Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.</p>

How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?"></a>3. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?</h4><p>The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.</p>
<p>Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.</p>
<p>If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, iMovie doesn’t have any preset glitch effects in its effects library, but you can still use it to create a glitch effect from scratch. The Video Overlay settings, Clip Filter options as well as the Split Screen feature enable you to overlay video clips and simulate the glitch effect.</p>
<p>Creating a glitch effect with iMovie requires you to have excellent video editing skills, and quite a bit of creativity as you have to plan the entire effect in advance. Even so the video editing tools you will have at your disposal are going to be limited so you shouldn’t expect to achieve breathtaking results. Adding an audio effect that accompanies the glitch effect may make this effect look more realistic.</p>

Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.</p>
<p>If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.</p>

That’s why you don’t necessarily have to use a glitch effect in order to make the video clip look damaged since a color effect or a camera shake effect can also be used for this purpose.

<p>Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.</p>

How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?"></a>1.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?</h4><p>If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Filmora Glitch transitions "
                ></p>
<p>However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Filmora Glitch  effects "
                ></p>
<p>You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.</p>

That’s why you don’t necessarily have to use a glitch effect in order to make the video clip look damaged since a color effect or a camera shake effect can also be used for this purpose. Moreover, combining several effects to create a glitch in a video is also an option, although this task may be overwhelming for inexperienced video editors.</p>

<p>We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.</p>
<p>Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.</p>

How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?"></a>1.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?</h4><p>If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Filmora Glitch transitions "
                ></p>
<p>However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Filmora Glitch  effects "
                ></p>
<p>You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.</p>

How to add the glitch effect to text in Filmora?</h4><p>The process of adding a glitch effect to text is simple, although you need to go through several different steps. You should start by choosing one of the available titles from Filmora’s Title tab and placing it on the timeline.</p>
<p>Double-click on the title you added, then click on the Advanced button and insert the text into the textbox. Proceed to set the text color to white, adjust its size and select a new font and then make sure that the No Animation option is selected in the Animation tab.</p>

<p> Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.</p>
<p>Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.</p>
<p>Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.</p>
<p>Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.</p>

How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?"></a>3. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?</h4><p>The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.</p>
<p>Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.</p>
<p>If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, iMovie doesn’t have any preset glitch effects in its effects library, but you can still use it to create a glitch effect from scratch. The Video Overlay settings, Clip Filter options as well as the Split Screen feature enable you to overlay video clips and simulate the glitch effect.</p>
<p>Creating a glitch effect with iMovie requires you to have excellent video editing skills, and quite a bit of creativity as you have to plan the entire effect in advance. Even so the video editing tools you will have at your disposal are going to be limited so you shouldn’t expect to achieve breathtaking results. Adding an audio effect that accompanies the glitch effect may make this effect look more realistic.</p>

What is a glitch effect?"></a>1. What is a glitch effect?</h4><p>A glitch effect can be any intervention you make on a video clip that makes that video look like it was recorded by a faulty camera or displayed on a malfunctioning display device. That’s why you don’t necessarily have to use a glitch effect in order to make the video clip look damaged since a color effect or a camera shake effect can also be used for this purpose. Moreover, combining several effects to create a glitch in a video is also an option, although this task may be overwhelming for inexperienced video editors.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 15360×8640 (16K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 5120 × 2880 (5K)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>

Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 15360×8640 (16K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>
