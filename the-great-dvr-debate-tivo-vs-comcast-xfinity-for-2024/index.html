<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"
                      alt="tivo comcast interface"
                ></p>
<p> Comcast interface</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"
                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"
                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>

<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4.

<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>

<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>

<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-3"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-3" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>

Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes"><a href="#3-Timescapes" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel"><a href="#6-Sintel" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks"><a href="#10-Fireworks" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2.

And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-2"><a href="#10-Fireworks-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-3"><a href="#3-Timescapes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-3"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-3"><a href="#6-Sintel-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees-3"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer-3"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-3"><a href="#10-Fireworks-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K.

<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Video-Editing-on-a-Mac"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Video-Editing-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to Video Editing on a Mac"></a>The Ultimate Guide to Video Editing on a Mac</h2><p>Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the best <strong>Apple</strong> <strong>video</strong> <strong>editing</strong> software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.</p>
<p>With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>
<p><em>Check how to use</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>QuickTime</em> <em>Player to Record Desktop Screen and Audio</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie"><a href="#4-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

<h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro"></a>5. Final Cut Pro</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> $299.99 for lifetime</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro is worth your attention if you would like a video editing program that you can use even if you may not have much expertise (and you plan on learning as a video editor when using it). It is one of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for professionals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to use on MacBook or iMac.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Final Cut Pro?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro is powerful editing software that experts use all over the world. It comes with extra features that are sure to appeal to Mac customers. It may require a few introductory videos to prepare yourself to start doing anything. Still, you can do basic editing and gradually master more complex techniques after you get your toes wet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy-to-Use Interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, Mac users would recognize the layout, which would make it much easier to use. But don’t be fooled by the product’s accessibility. It’s still a strong tool, and once you get used to it, the magnetic interface makes editing film a breeze.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>360-Degree VR and 3D Tilting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Multicam editing, XML imports, and 360-degree VR content are supported, and color grading capabilities have been enhanced. Additional abilities, such as 3D titling and an outstanding Flow transition to ease out jump cuts, have been added to these functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>90-Day Free Trial</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple provides a free 90-day trial, so you can see whether this is something you’d be interested in before committing. HDR material may be created. That’s simply the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Apple Video Editing</strong> apps to make video editing easier for you. Nowadays, when someone asks you about the kind of video editing software you’re using on your IOS device, you can proudly tell them about the one you like here the most.</p>

Download 4K videos</h4><p>In the browser when your video is loading, you will find a floating Download button. It will emerge at the above right corner of the video frame. Now one can download the video directly by clicking on to that download button. Then the program will start to analyze. You can also find video-related information like download speed, size, and name of the video during download.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts. You should opt for dragging the URL into the program if the file size is huge. Because waiting for the video to load becomes arduous.</p>
<p>Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.</p>

After installation, launch this program and browse through it to get a hang of it. Its user-friendly interface will make your work a lot easier.</p>

Search for the 4K videos you wish to download"></a>Step 2. Search for the 4K videos you wish to download</h4><p>4K videos are supported in the browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and IE. In any of these browsers go to the media streaming websites. Search for the type of 4K videos you like. Select one and play that video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="Step-3-Download-4K-videos-3"><a href="#Step-3-Download-4K-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Download 4K videos"></a>Step 3. Download 4K videos</h4><p>In the browser when your video is loading, you will find a floating Download button. It will emerge at the above right corner of the video frame. Now one can download the video directly by clicking on to that download button. Then the program will start to analyze. You can also find video-related information like download speed, size, and name of the video during download.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts. You should opt for dragging the URL into the program if the file size is huge. Because waiting for the video to load becomes arduous.</p>
<p>Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.</p>
