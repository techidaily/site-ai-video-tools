So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.</p>
<p> However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.</p>
<p> However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

<p> Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MP4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >media players <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as well as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >online video hosting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and social media platforms.</p>

That is why in this article we are going to take a look at the 10 best WebM to MP4 converters on the market.</p>

<p> You don’t need any previous experience with the file conversion process to convert a WebM video to MP4 with the online file conversion platform.

<p> However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

<p> Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MP4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >media players <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as well as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >online video hosting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and social media platforms.</p>
<p> WebM, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for videos that are viewed from Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but only a handful of desktop-based media players offer support for this video file format. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at the 10 best WebM to MP4 converters on the market.</p>
<h2 id="The-10-Best-WebM-to-MP4-Converters-3"><a href="#The-10-Best-WebM-to-MP4-Converters-3" class="headerlink" title="The 10 Best WebM to MP4 Converters"></a>The 10 Best WebM to MP4 Converters</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Changing the format of a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> file is never a complicated process, regardless of the software or the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >web-based application <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you are using. However, the duration, speed, and quality of the conversion process depend on the converter you’ve selected for this task. Here are the ten best WebM to MP4 converters that make the file conversion process swift and smooth.</p>
<h3 id="1-UniConverter-3"><a href="#1-UniConverter-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

The amount of time you will have to wait for the conversion process to be completed varies on the desktop and online versions of UniConverter, and you can only convert two WebM files to MP4 at the same time with the online version of this file converter.</p>

<p> Afterward, you should click on the Add button and proceed to import the WebM file into the media player, and then click on the Browse button in order to specify the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved. When done, you should click on the Convert&#x2F;Save button to initiate the file conversion process.</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets.

<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>

<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

<p>This branded movie maker is free on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.moviemaker.thelegomovie2" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>

<li>For users 12+ with a focus on B2B adult target market</li>
<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular.

<li>For users 12+ with a focus on B2B adult target market</li>
<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

<h2 id="Basic-Tips-for-Improving-Lego-stop-motion-videos-1"><a href="#Basic-Tips-for-Improving-Lego-stop-motion-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Tips for Improving Lego stop motion videos"></a>Basic Tips for Improving Lego stop motion videos</h2><p>The essential ingredients for the best Lego movies include creativity and patience. If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-1"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-1"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-1"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets. You can now use apps to bring a story alive. Drag those bricks down from the attic or pull them out of the kids’ box, as you could have a potential goldmine in your home.</p>

You only need a basic set of Lego bricks and your smartphone or iPad if you want to keep it simple. You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-2"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-2"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-2"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-2"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets. You can now use apps to bring a story alive. Drag those bricks down from the attic or pull them out of the kids’ box, as you could have a potential goldmine in your home.</p>

You only need a basic set of Lego bricks and your smartphone or iPad if you want to keep it simple. You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>

Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-3"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-3"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason.

<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>
