<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.</p>

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price"><a href="#Price" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>

<p> We love <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It’s great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8" >LumaFusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It’s widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we’ve picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p> It’s not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it’s amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.</p>
<p> Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p> It’s great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it’s important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you’re serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.</p>
<p> Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it’s worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance-1"><a href="#Performance-1" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-1"><a href="#Price-1" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>

Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-2"><a href="#Price-2" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>

<p><strong>1. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p> We love <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>

<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac.

<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>

<p> It’s not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it’s amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.</p>
<p> Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.</p>

<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>

<p>Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos.

<p>Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos. It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.</p>

<p>Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos. It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.</p>

Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory"><a href="#2-Memory" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic"><a href="#3-Graphic" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings"><a href="#5-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive"><a href="#6-Drive" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory-2"><a href="#2-Memory-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic-2"><a href="#3-Graphic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings-2"><a href="#5-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive-2"><a href="#6-Drive-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-2"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

<p>We all know that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best professional video editing software, while to run such a powerful video editing software, you may need a powerful windows PC or Mac as well. Though most modern computer systems can run Adobe Premiere out of the box, there are some steps to take, and potential decisions to make, before installing the software, or if you are building or buying a new computer to make sure you get the best experience possible with the software.</p>
