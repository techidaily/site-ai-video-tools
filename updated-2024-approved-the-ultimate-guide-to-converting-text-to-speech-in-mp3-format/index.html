<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

It’s the online <strong>text to human voice converter</strong>, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Text-to-Speech has only continued to grow popular with content creators as the technology of it improves — allowing for more natural sounding voices and endless customizations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech converters work in much the same way. All you need to do is upload the text you want to convert, adjust the voice and sound settings as needed, and you’re done!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, there are some extra little tidbits that you might also want to know in order to enhance your converted text. Our general advice for that is to experiment to the fullest and make sure that you finish everything up with a high-quality video editor like Filmora to ensure that your finished project is as near to perfect as possible!</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>
<p><img

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png"
                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video"><a href="#1-Merge-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert"><a href="#3-Aconvert" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>

When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-FlexClip"><a href="#6-FlexClip" class="headerlink" title="6.

You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video. Hit the Export button after you’ve arranged the video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the video and proceed to pick a 480p, 720p or 1080p output quality.</p>

<h2 id="The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3"><a href="#The-Best-Free-Online-Video-Mergers-in-2022-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022"></a>The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022</h2><p>The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="1-Merge-Video-3"><a href="#1-Merge-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Video"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergevideo.online/" >Merge Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>
<h4 id="3-Aconvert-3"><a href="#3-Aconvert-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Aconvert"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/" >Aconvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.</p>
<h4 id="4-Kapwing-3"><a href="#4-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.</p>

You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute.

Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let’s take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.</p>
<p>A possible solution can be using some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device.

Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let’s take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.</p>
<p>A possible solution can be using some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device. For this purpose, one can refer to Wondershare Filmora video editor. That can be the perfect solution to this problem. Wondershare Filmora provides options to adjust the video resolution or modify the video’s aspect ratio as per the requirement at your ease from anywhere, any location. That looks awesome.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 11"
                ></p>
<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>
<h2 id="Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask"><a href="#Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask"></a>Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>

<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="fx chroma 11"
                ></p>
<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started-2"><a href="#Getting-Started-2" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started-3"><a href="#Getting-Started-3" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key-3"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key-3" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>

                     lazyload
