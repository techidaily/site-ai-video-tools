<li>Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.</li>
<li>You can also contribute to the website’s library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.</li>
<li>The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.</li>
<li>Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.</li>

<p>Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers"><a href="#Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Buy from stock providers"></a>Part 2: Buy from stock providers</h2><p>Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry’s finest to edge out the competition.</li>
<li>You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.</li>
<li>Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.</li>
<li>Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="1-iStock"><a href="#1-iStock" class="headerlink" title="1. iStock"></a>1. iStock</h3><p>iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.</p>
<h3 id="2-Alamy-com"><a href="#2-Alamy-com" class="headerlink" title="2. Alamy.com"></a>2. Alamy.com</h3><p>Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy’s services include M&amp;C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools"><a href="#Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools"></a>Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools</h2><p>Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare’s Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.</li>
<li>You have full ownership of the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.</p>
<p>However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.</p>
<h3 id="It-requires-a-substantial-investment"><a href="#It-requires-a-substantial-investment" class="headerlink" title="It requires a substantial investment"></a>It requires a substantial investment</h3><p>Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.</p>
<h3 id="There-is-a-steep-learning-curve"><a href="#There-is-a-steep-learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="There is a steep learning curve"></a>There is a steep learning curve</h3><p>Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort.

<p>When you’re taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you’ll need to decide if it’ll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that’s where the knowledge regarding the <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> comes in!</p>

<p>This post will dive into the rise of the phone aspect ratio vertical, including best practices on using <strong>phone ratio calculator</strong> and <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong> based on its final viewing platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or broadcast.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>

Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

If you encounter this problem and learn to isolate, troubleshoot, and fix this issue following the below methods, you will likely resolve the crashing problem on your own.

Resetting preferences will not affect your projects, libraries, or media. With resetting, we mean that you should change the custom preference settings to the default settings. Before you take the plunge to reset your preferences, you should choose Final Cut Pro over Preferences and note all the specific settings that you have to make.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to reset the preferences in Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Quit working on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold down the option and command keys, then open the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the delete preferences option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the last step, recreate the issue that you were having during video editing. If the problem is resolved, you should open Final Cut Pro preferences and apply the custom settings again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> And, it’s done!</p>
<p>This method will reset all your preferences to default settings and this way it will empty the list of the recent libraries and media. Though the entire libraries are not erased, you will be able to find them in the specified location when you first created them. But they will only be there if you have created a back-up of your data. That is why we mentioned in the beginning to create a back-up of your Final Cut Pro data in the first place.</p>
<p>With the help of fixing the Final Cut Pro X preferences, you will be able to fix a lot of your problems especially the crashing one. The preferences are deeply embedded into the program operation even if we cannot directly amend most of them.</p>
