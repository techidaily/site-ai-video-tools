There is no limit to video resolution thus whether it is standard or HD does not really matter at Cinelerra. Cinelerra always has been free and may remain so since developers are working very closely with traditional technical design &amp; manufacturing companies and media and broadcast production companies all along with the Independent Artists &amp; Technologists to bring some new capabilities and higher functionality. We know that Cinelerra isn’t perfect, however, it’s one platform that we can build on together to make our independent and professional studios.</p>
